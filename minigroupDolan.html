<p> The use of weather radar data is ingrained in the Bell group research in a variety of facets. Radar data from aircraft reconnaissance (such as the tail Doppler Radar) and ground-based Doppler, polarimetric radar are used to study hurricanes, precipitation, and dynamics. 
The team is actively involved in the <a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/airborne-phased-array-radar-apar-0"> Aircraft Phased Array Radar </a> project led by NCAR, and maintains the deployable Sea-going and Land-based Polarimetric C-band radar, 
<a href="https://seapol.colostate.edu"> SEA-POL </a> alongside Prof. V. Chandrasekar in the CSU ECE department. The Bell group has participated or led a number of field campaigns in recent years, including 
<a href="http://precip.org">PRECIP </a>(Precipitation of Rainfall Extremes Campaign in the Pacific), 
Process Investigation of Clouds and Convective Organization over the atLantic Ocean, <a href="https://orcestra-campaign.org/piccolo.html">PICCOLO </a>, 
and Snow Sensitivity to Clouds in a Mountain Environment (<a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/s2noclime"> S2noCliME </a>). </p>

<p> The members of the TC-RAMS research group that are part of the Radar and Field Experiment minigroup are: Lauren Beard, Delián Colón Burgos, Nick Mesa, Meghan Stell, and Brenda Dolan (lead)</p>
