The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is predicted to be above-normal.  The Atlantic basin Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) and Net Tropical Cyclone (NTC) activity are predicted to be about 125% of their long-term averages (1991-2020).  The forecast team is forecasting 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an Accumulated Cyclone Energy of 155 (the average is 123).  Because of the anticipated active season, there is a higher than average probability of major hurricanes making landfall.  There is a 51% probability of a major hurricane making landfall along the U.S. coastline and a 56% probability for a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean.

The Department of Atmospheric Science has been issuing seasonal hurricane forecasts since 1984 and an April forecast has been issued since 1995.  The forecasts are based on a combination of a statistical model and an ensemble of dynamical model predictions.  One of the primary goals for issuing such a forecast is to raise public awareness about tropical cyclones, the upcoming season, and the need to prepare in advance for potential community impacts from the anticipated extreme weather.  The Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling, and Software Team (TC-RAMS), led by Professor Michael Bell, conducted numerous interviews with media outlets.
