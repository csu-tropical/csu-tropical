During the second week of May, the 36th Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology provided a perfect venue for 8 different members of the CSU Tropical Weather and Climate Research group, led by professor Bell, to present numerous research projects.   The conference allowed for the sharing of current research as well as the ability to reunite with former group members.
