This Fall the Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling, and Software Team (TC-RAMS) welcomes three new graduate students.  Wa are excited to welcome Lauren Beard, Chandler Jenkins, and Meghan Stell into the M.S. program.  Meghan Stell is an Associate Scientist at NCAR and has spent two summers working on research projects with the NSF SOARS program.  Meghan has a passion for field projects and is eager to continue developing as a scientist.  Chandler "CJ" Jenkins is passionate about tropical cyclones and weather and has also spent time doing research through the NSF SOARS program.  Chandler will be using a numerical model to simulate individual hurricanes and investigate the mechanisms that are critical to formation and lifecycle.  Lauren Beard has pursued various lines of research focused on clouds and how we can observe them.  Lauren's initial research will use polarimetric radar data to explore the links between aerosol concentration, microphysical processes and precipitation.
