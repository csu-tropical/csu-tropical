Naufal Razin and Jon Martinez received awards at the 34th AMS Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology on May 14. Razin won the first-place student poster award for “Tropical Cyclone Precipitation, Infrared, Microwave, and Environmental Dataset (TC PRIMED).” Martinez won the second-place student poster award for “Characterizing the Nature and Evolution of Asymmetric Structures in Idealized Simulations of Rapidly Intensifying Tropical Cyclones,” as well as the conference’s top award, the Max Eaton Student Prize for “On the Contributions of Incipient Vortex Circulation and Environmental Moisture to Tropical Cyclone Expansion.”

The Max Eaton Prize is given every two years for the outstanding combination of presentation and paper at the AMS Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology. The prize was established to recognize Max A. Eaton’s lifelong contributions to tropical meteorology and the encouragement he gave to young researchers.

“It’s an honor to have two of my research projects acknowledged with such valuable awards at the Hurricane Conference,” Martinez said. “Both awards represent the culmination of collaborative research projects, and I’m grateful that our ideas are permeating throughout the community!”

Co-authors on Razin’s poster included Chris Slocum, Paula Brown and John Knaff, and Chelsea Nam co-authored Martinez’ Max Eaton paper and presentation.

“These awards would not have been possible without their significant contributions,” Professor Michael Bell, Razin’s and Martinez’ adviser, acknowledged the co-authors. Bell noted that TC PRIMED was supported by an ATS/CIRA PRSE grant.

“This project is a heavily collaborative effort, and I couldn’t have done it without my TC PRIMED team from ATS and CIRA,” Razin said.
