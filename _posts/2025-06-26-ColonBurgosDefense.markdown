Delián Colón Burgos defends her research with the title, "Dynamics of Convective Organization in African Easterly Waves observed during the NAMMA and CPEX-CV Field
Campaigns".

Congratulations Delián!   Delián's work dives into the details of the different ways that tropical convection can be organized in the early stages of easterly waves, which in many cases develop into TC's.  Her research uses multiple sources of observations as well as a novel computational method to combine observations with ERA5 reanalysis data.  The observations that Delián used were gathered during two distinct field campaigns in the tropical Atlantic.

Thesis Abstract: 

The mechanisms that govern the organization of moist convection in weakly rotating flows such as tropical easterly waves are not
fully understood. In this study we aim to better understand the dynamical processes that govern the convective organization at the
meso-alpha scale, including the location, and intensity of deep convection, using NASA airborne field campaign and satellite
observations. We employ a 3D variational analysis technique called SAMURAI in a vortex-centric approach, integrating ERA5
reanalysis and research aircraft observations of 20 African easterly wave (AEW) cases collected during NAMMA in 2006 and CPEX-CV
in 2022. The SAMURAI analyses are centered on a potential vorticity (PV) centroid and show a low-level wave relative circulation
across cases. Convection is classified from satellite imagery into two classes of shallow/moderate and deep to obtain a frequency of
the occurrence relative to the PV centroid location. We find four clusters of organized deep convection denoted as minimal deep,
southern, southwestern, and widespread, with the southwestern and widespread clusters associated with the greatest magnitudes
of frequency. Results from a composite analysis reveal high PV and relative humidity (RH) at mid-levels were approximately co-
located with the regions of low-level convergence and more frequent deep convection, particularly for the southwestern and
widespread clusters. A statistically higher correlation of waves with a higher frequency of deep convection are characterized by
stronger PV and RH at mid-levels compared to waves with a lower frequency of deep convection and ample moisture at low to mid-
levels. Further research is recommended to explore these relationships temporally to better determine the role of cause and effect
between the PV and RH and deep convective organization.
