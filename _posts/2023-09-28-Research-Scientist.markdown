The CSU Tropical Weather and Climate research team is led by Professor Michael Bell and conducts cutting-edge research to advance knowledge and prediction of the weather and climate system. The research group is focused on improved understanding and prediction of tropical weather, including hurricanes and typhoons, extreme rainfall, and other high impact weather.

A Research Scientist is needed to conduct research on tropical weather and climate, and to support scientific dissemination and broader media outreach of research team results. The position is needed to support extramurally funded research from the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, NASA, and private foundations. This position will conduct research that addresses fundamental aspects of understanding and prediction of tropical weather and climate with a focus in the areas of heavy rainfall and tropical cyclone genesis, intensification, and seasonal activity, including the following:

Perform fundamental research in tropical weather and climate using in situ and remotely sensed observations and numerical weather prediction models.

Analyze and interpret complex, nonlinear cloud, precipitation, and boundary layer processes, and other micro- and meso-, synoptic, and climate scale aspects of weather systems from both models and observations.

The research will be performed by using research analysis software, analysis of field campaign data, and running of numerical weather prediction models. A particular focus of the effort will be to do research associated with data collected during the Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification (TCRI), Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign in the Pacific (PRECIP), and Convective Processes Experiment-Cabo Verde (CPEX-CV) field campaigns. 

The Scientist will also help support the team's media and outreach efforts, including maintenance and development of content for the group webpage, coordinating and conducting interviews with news media, and educational outreach. A PhD in Atmospheric Science or related field is required.

The expected end results are formal publications and other informal media content disseminated in the peer-reviewed science literature, web, social, and news media on tropical cyclone seasonal activity, genesis, and intensification and heavy rainfall prediction. This position will report to Professor Michael Bell and will be located in Fort Collins.

The Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University is a large academic and research department in the Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering. We currently have twenty-three faculty members, eighty graduate students, over seventy full-time researchers and postdoctoral fellows, and an outstanding and dedicated support staff, that comprise one of the most research-active units at the university. The department conducts more than $14M in externally sponsored research each year and is nationally ranked near the top of its field.

For full consideration, please submit applications by 20 October 2023. The full job description and link to apply are at [https://jobs.colostate.edu/postings/133947](https://jobs.colostate.edu/postings/133947)
