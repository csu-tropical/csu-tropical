Delián Colón Burgos gave a talk on hurricanes to middle school students at Radians School in Cayey, 
Puerto Rico! She was invited as a guest speaker as part of the school’s Science Week focused on the theme 
of the four elements: earth, fire, water, air.

Delián led an interactive presentation (including hurricane preparation based family feud!) that was attended by more than 100 students. 
She discussed tropical cyclone formation, and risks, hurricane seasons, and how scientists study these systems. Radians School is the 
school that Delián attended from pre-school through 12th grade, she was really excited and honored to give back to her alma mater!
