  keypoint1: "A new radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) configuration is added to the official release of Community Earth System Model (CESM) to facilitate the use of Radiative-Convective Equilibrium Model Intercomparison Project (RCEMIP) in the CESM hierarchy" 
  keypoint2: "The Community Atmosphere Model version 5 and Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) RCEMIP climate states and variation across SST experiments are documented in the context of the CESM hierarchy"

a reduction of low-level clouds in CAM6, consistent with differences in more realistic simulations"
  abstract: "Abstract Characteristics of, and fundamental differences between, the radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) climate states following the Radiative-Convective Equilibrium Model Intercomparison Project (RCEMIP) protocols in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) and version 6 (CAM6) are presented. This paper explores the characteristics of clouds, moisture, precipitation and circulation in the RCE state, as well as the tropical response to surface warming, in CAM5 and CAM6 with different parameterizations. Overall, CAM5 simulates higher precipitation rates that result in larger global average precipitation, despite lower outgoing longwave radiation compared to CAM6. Differences in the structure of clouds, particularly the amount and vertical location of cloud liquid, exist between the CAM versions and can, in part, be related to distinct representations of shallow convection and boundary layer processes. Both CAM5 and CAM6 simulate similar peaks in cloud fraction, relative humidity, and cloud ice, linked to the usage of a similar deep convection parameterization. These anvil clouds rise and decrease in extent in response to surface warming. More generally, extreme precipitation, aggregation of convection, and climate sensitivity increase with warming in both CAM5 and CAM6. This analysis provides a benchmark for future studies that explore clouds, convection, and climate in CAM with the RCEMIP protocols now available in the Community Earth System Model. These results are discussed within the context of realistic climate simulations using CAM5 and CAM6, highlighting the usefulness of a hierarchical modeling approach to understanding model and parameterization sensitivities to inform model development efforts." 
  summary: "Clouds, circulations and rainfall in the tropics play an important role
in Earth's climate. However, global climate models differ in their representation of these features, contributing to uncertainty in future climate projections. One useful tool to better understand model differences and inform efforts to improve models is to analyze idealized configurations. We explore two different numerical representations of an idealized atmosphere relevant to tropical regions to determine the impact on the characteristics of clouds, rainfall and circulations as well as the tropical atmospheric response to warming.  We show that our idealized models mirror differences in the low-cloud structure in the deep tropics of more realistic models. This work also finds similarities between the two numerical representations, such as a decrease in the spatial extent of high altitude clouds with warming. As the surface is warmed, both versions also show increases in the clustering of clouds, the likelihood of extreme precipitation rates, and an estimate of how much warming would occur in response to a doubling of carbon dioxide."
