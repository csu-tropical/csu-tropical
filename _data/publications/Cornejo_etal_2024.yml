  abstract: "Taiwan regularly receives extreme rainfall due to seasonal mei-yu fronts that are modi ed by Taiwan’s com-
plex topography. One such case occurred between 1 and 3 June 2017 when a mei-yu front contributed to ooding and land-
slides from over 600 mm of rainfall in 12 h near the Taipei basin, and over 1500 mm of rainfall in 2 days near the Central
Mountain Range (CMR). This mei-yu event is simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model with
halved terrain as a sensitivity test to investigate the orographic mechanisms that modify the intensity, duration, and location of
extreme rainfall. The reduction in WRF terrain height produced a decrease in rainfall duration and accumulation in northern
Taiwan and a decrease in rainfall duration, intensity, and accumulation over the CMR. The reductions in northern Taiwan are
linked to a weaker orographic barrier jet resulting from a lowered terrain height. The reductions in rainfall intensity and dura-
tion over the CMR are partially explained by a lack of orographic enhancements to mei-yu frontal convergence near the ter-
rain. A prominent feature missing with the reduced terrain is a redirection of postfrontal westerly winds attributed to
orographic deformation, i.e., the redirection of ow due to upstream topography. Orographically deforming winds converge
with prefrontal ow to maintain the mei-yu front. In both regions, the decrease in mei-yu front propagation speed is linked to
increased rainfall duration. These orographic features will be further explored using observations captured during the 2022
Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign in the Paci c (PRECIP) eld campaign."
