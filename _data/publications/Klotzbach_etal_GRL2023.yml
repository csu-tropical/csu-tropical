  keypoint1: The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) significantly impacts continental US hurricane landfall frequency 
  keypoint2: Gulf Coast hurricane landfalls are favored when the MJO is enhancing Western Pacific/Western Hemisphere convection
  keypoint3: East Coast hurricane landfalls are favored when the MJO is enhancing Indian Ocean/Maritime Continent convection
  abstract: The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) significantly impacts North Atlantic hurricanes, with increased hurricane activity occurring when the MJO enhances convection over Africa and the tropical Indian Ocean and suppressed hurricane activity occurring when the MJO enhances convection over the tropical Pacific. Using data from 1905 to 2015, we find more tropical cyclones (TCs) make landfall in the continental United States when the MJO enhances tropical Indian Ocean convection. In addition, when the MJO enhances Western Pacific and Western Hemisphere convection, TC activity is preferentially favored in the Caribbean, leading to more Gulf Coast landfalls. As MJO-enhanced convection moves to the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent, more storms form in the tropical Atlantic, favoring Florida Peninsula and East Coast landfalls. The MJO's TC steering wind modulation appears to be secondary to its genesis location modulation.
