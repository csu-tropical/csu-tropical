  keypoint1: Observations from PREDICT/GRIP/IFEX field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010).
  keypoint2: The onset of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely
    related to the coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels.
  keypoint3: The convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and midlevel
    circulations leading to genesis episodically.
  abstract: Observations from the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in
    the Tropics (PREDICT), Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), and
    Intensity Forecast Experiment (IFEX) field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010). Research aircraft missions provided Doppler radar, in situ flight level,
    and dropsonde data documenting the structural changes of the predepression disturbance.
    Following the pre-Karl wave pouch, variational analyses at the meso-β and meso-α
    scales suggest that the convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and
    midlevel circulations leading to genesis episodically rather than through a sustained
    lowering of the convective mass flux from increased stabilization. Convective
    bursts that erupt in the vorticity-rich environment of the recirculating pouch
    region enhance the low-level meso-β- and meso-α-scale circulation through vortex
    stretching. As the convection wanes, the resulting stratiform precipitation strengthens
    the midlevel circulation through convergence associated with ice microphysical
    processes, protecting the disturbance from the intrusion of dry environmental
    air. Once the column saturation fraction returns to a critical value, a subsequent
    convective burst below the midlevel circulation further enhances the low-level
    circulation, and the convective cycle repeats. The analyses suggest that the onset
    of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely related to the
    coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels. Our interpretation
    of the observational analysis presented in this study reaffirms a primary role
    of deep convection in the genesis process and provides a hypothesis for the supporting
    role of stratiform precipitation and the midlevel vortex.

  title: Modulation of Bay of Bengal tropical cyclone activity by the Madden-Julian
    oscillation

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.06.010
  keypoint1: Bay of Bengal TC activity is significantly enhanced when the convectively
    active MJO phase is positioned over the eastern Indian Ocean and the Maritime
    Continent
  keypoint2: Bay of Bengal TC activity is significantly suppressed when the convectively
    active MJO phase is positioned over the Western Hemisphere and Africa
  keypoint3: MJO modulations of Bay of Bengal TC activity are stronger in the post-monsoon
    than pre-monsoon cyclone season
  abstract: The influence of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) on global tropical
    cyclone (TC) activity has been well documented in many earlier studies. However,
    no prior studies have focused specifically on the MJO's impacts on TCs in the
    Bay of Bengal (BoB). Therefore, the present study examines the impact of the MJO
    on BoB TC activity during the two peak TC periods i.e. April–June (AMJ) and October–December
    (OND) from 1974 to 2015. The MJO considerably modulates various measures of TC
    activity in the BoB, including the number of TCs, the number of TC days, accumulated
    cyclone energy, the power dissipation index, TC genesis location and TC tracks.
    TC activity is significantly enhanced (suppressed) over the BoB when the convectively
    active MJO phase is positioned over the eastern Indian Ocean and the Maritime
    Continent (the Western Hemisphere and Africa). Alterations in the TC genesis locations
    and their tracks are more pronounced in OND than in AMJ. These changes in TC characteristics
    are mainly attributed to MJO-driven modulations in large-scale environmental conditions
    such as deep convection, mid-tropospheric relative humidity, sea surface temperature,
    sea level pressure, lower and upper-level winds and vertical wind shear. A comprehensive
    knowledge of the MJO-TC relationship may be beneficial for short-term predictions
    of TC activity in the BoB.

  keypoint1: Three-dimensional temperature and pressure perturbations are retrieved in Hurricane Rita on 23 September 2005 from multi-Doppler radar data that are believed to be the first fully three-dimensional gridded thermodynamic observations from a TC.
  keypoint2: The analysis suggests the interpretation of eyewall convective forcing under the impacts of vertical wind shear within a three-level framework of balanced, quasi-balanced, and unbalanced motions
  keypoint3: Observed wavenumber-1 thermodynamic asymmetries add new evidence that the vertical motion is nearly hydrostatic on the wavenumber-1 scale, while higher-order wavenumbers were associated with unbalanced motions and convective cells within the eyewall that were positively correlated with buoyant forcing from thermal perturbations and negatively correlated with perturbation pressure gradients relative to the balanced vortex.
  abstract: The newly developed SAMURAI-TR is used to estimate three-dimensional temperature and pressure perturbations in Hurricane Rita on 23 September 2005 from multi-Doppler radar data during the RAINEX field campaign. These are believed to be the first fully three-dimensional gridded thermodynamic observations from a TC. Rita was a major hurricane at this time and was affected by 13 m s−1 deep-layer vertical wind shear. Analysis of the contributions of the kinematic and retrieved thermodynamic fields to different azimuthal wavenumbers suggests the interpretation of eyewall convective forcing within a three-level framework of balanced, quasi-balanced, and unbalanced motions. The axisymmetric, wavenumber-0 structure was approximately in thermal- wind balance, resulting in a large pressure drop and temperature increase toward the center. The wavenumber-1 structure was determined by the interaction of the storm with environmental vertical wind shear resulting in a quasi-balance between shear and shear-induced kinematic and thermo- dynamic perturbations. The observed wavenumber-1 thermodynamic asymmetries corroborate results of previous studies on the response of a vortex tilted by shear, and add new evidence that the vertical motion is nearly hydrostatic on the wavenumber-1 scale. Higher-order wavenumbers were associated with unbalanced motions and convective cells within the eyewall. The unbalanced vertical acceleration was positively correlated with buoyant forcing from thermal perturbations and negatively correlated with perturbation pressure gradients relative to the balanced vortex.

  abstract: Here we discuss recent progress in understanding tropical cyclone (TC)
    subseasonal variability and its prediction. There has been a concerted effort
    to understand the sources of predictability at subseasonal time-scales, and this
    effort has continued to make progress in recent years. Besides the Madden-Julian
    Oscillation (MJO), other modes of variability affect TCs at these time-scales,
    in particular various equatorial waves. Additionally, TC activity is also modulated
    by extratropical processes via Rossby wave breaking. There has also been progress
    in the ability of models to simulate the MJO and its modulation of TC activity.
    Community efforts have created multi-model ensemble datasets, which have made
    it possible to evaluate the forecast skill of the MJO and TCs on subseasonal time-scales
    in multiple forecasting systems. While there is positive skill in some cases,
    there is strong dependence on the ensemble system considered, the basin examined,
    and whether the storms have extratropical influences or not. Furthermore, the
    definition of skill differs among studies. Forecasting centers are currently issuing
    subseasonal TC forecasts using various techniques (statistical, statistical-dynamical
    and dynamical). There is also a strong interest in the private sector for forecasts
    with 3-4 weeks lead time.

  title: An Intensity and Size Phase Space for Tropical Cyclone Structure and Evolution

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD037089
  keypoint1: Key features of tropical cyclone intensity and size can be captured through empirical orthogonal function analysis of observed winds
  keypoint2: The new, observation-derived phase space provides a useful visualization of tropical cyclone structure evolution
  keypoint3: A new structure parameter related to the radial decay of winds is introduced to represent maturity
  abstract: Intensity and size are important to characterize a tropical cyclone (TC), but there are a wide variety of ways that both metrics are defined. TC intensity can refer to either a maximum sustained wind speedat some height level or central surface pressure minimum, and TC size may refer to the radius of maximum wind, the radius of gale force wind, or be based on other criteria. While different definitions of TC intensity and size have useful applications, there are varying amounts of redundant information and covariations between some size and intensity variables that make investigating physical relationships more challenging. In this study, we use aircraft observations and Best Track information to calculate an empirical orthogonal function analysis that yields new, orthogonal metrics of TC intensity and size. The new, linearly independent metrics reduce a seven-dimensional space of co-varying parameters into a simplified, two-dimensional phase space in which key TC structural changes can be visualized and historically contextualized. Additionally, our analysis introduces a new parameter that is a simplified measure of the wind decay outside the radius of maximum tangential velocity. We show that this decay parameter is nearly orthogonal to the new intensity and size metrics and is useful for identifying TC maturity. We demonstrate the utility of the new phase space by first comparing the structural evolution of the large Hurricane Rita (2005) and small Hurricane Charley (2004) using observations, as well as comparing two modeling simulations of Hurricane Rita with different initial conditions in the phase space.
  summary: Intensity and size are important ways to characterize a tropical cyclone (TC), but there are a variety of ways these metrics are defined. While each definition has its uses, traditional metrics have redundant information, which makes investigating physical relationships more challenging. This study proposes new metrics of intensity and size that are both independent and based on observed variability, as well as introduces a new metric that describes TC maturity. Together, these new metrics distill a lot of information into a simplified, easy-to-understand view of TC intensity and structure, which is demonstrated with observations of Hurricanes Rita (2005) and Charley (2004), as well as with numerical simulations of Hurricane Rita.

  keypoint1: The strength of the immersed boundary method constraints can impact the overall retrieval analysis. 
  keypoint2: The algorithm assumptions regarding the mass continuity and the terrain boundary conditions, especially the Dirichlet condition, are essential for generating realistic wind retrieval. 
  keypoint3: The smoothness of complex terrain slopes is found to influence the overall retrieval. 
  abstract: The interaction of airflow with complex terrain has the potential to significantly amplify extreme precipitation events and modify the structure and intensity of precipitating cloud systems. However, understanding and forecasting such events is challenging, in part due to the scarcity of direct in-situ measurements. Doppler radar can provide the capability to monitor extreme rainfall events over land, but our understanding of airflow modulated by orographic interactions remains limited. The SAMURAI software is a three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) technique that uses the finite element approach to retrieve kinematic and thermodynamic fields. The analysis has high fidelity to observations when retrieving flows over a flat surface, but the capability of imposing topography as a boundary constraint is not previously implemented. Here we implement the immersed boundary method (IBM) as pseudo-observations at their native coordinates in SAMURAI to represent the topographic forcing and surface impermeability. In this technique, neither data interpolation onto a Cartesian grid nor explicit physical constraint integration during the cost function minimization is needed. Furthermore, the physical constraints are treated as pseudo-observations, offering the flexibility to adjust the strength of the boundary condition. A series of observing simulation sensitivity experiments (OSSEs) using a full-physics model and radar emulator simulating rainfall from Typhoon Chanthu (2021) over Taiwan are conducted to evaluate the retrieval accuracy and parameter settings. The OSSE results show that the strength of the IBM constraints can impact the overall wind retrievals. Analysis from real radar observations further demonstrates that the improved retrieval technique can advance scientific analyses for the underlying dynamics of orographic precipitation using radar observations.
  summary: In this study, the immersed boundary method has been successfully implemented into a three-dimensional variational-based multi-Doppler radar wind synthesis algorithm.

  abstract: Hurricane Matthew (2016) was observed by the ground-based polarimetric Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) in Miami (KAMX) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration WP-3D (NOAA P-3) airborne tail Doppler radar near the coast of the southeastern United States for several hours, providing a novel opportunity to evaluate and compare single- and multiple-Doppler wind retrieval techniques for tropical cyclone flows. The generalized velocity track display (GVTD) technique can retrieve a subset of the wind field from a single ground-based Doppler radar under the assumption of nearly axisymmetric rotational wind, but it has been shown to have errors from the aliasing of unresolved wind components. An improved technique that mitigates errors due to storm motion is derived in this study, although some spatial aliasing remains due to limited information content from the single-Doppler measurements. A spline-based variational wind retrieval technique called SAMURAI can retrieve the full three-dimensional wind field from airborne radar fore–aft pseudo-dual-Doppler scanning, but it has been shown to have errors due to temporal aliasing from the nonsimultaneous Doppler measurements. A comparison between the two techniques shows that the axisymmetric tangential winds are generally comparable between the two techniques, and the improved GVTD technique improves the accuracy of the retrieval. Fourier decomposition of asymmetric kinematic and convective structure shows more discrepancies due to spatial and temporal aliasing in the retrievals. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique for studying tropical cyclone structure are discussed and suggest that complementary information can be retrieved from both single- and dual-Doppler retrievals. Future improvements to the asymmetric flow assumptions in single-Doppler analysis and steady-state assumptions in pseudo-dual-Doppler analysis are required to reconcile differences in retrieved tropical cyclone structure.
  summary: Doppler radar provides high-resolution wind measurements within tropical cyclones (TCs) for real-time monitoring and weather forecasting. Hurricane Matthew (2016) was observed by the ground-based single-Doppler and NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter airborne radar simultaneously, providing a novel opportunity to compare single- and multiple-Doppler wind retrieval techniques. Here, we improve the single-Doppler wind retrieval algorithm and show the pros and cons of each method for studying TC structure.

  abstract: Hurricane Matthew (2016) was observed by ground-based polarimetric radars in Miami (KAMX), Melbourne (KMLB), and Jacksonville, Florida (KJAX), and a NOAA P3 airborne tail Doppler radar near the coast of the southeastern United States during an eyewall replacement cycle (ERC). The radar observations indicate that Matthew’s primary eyewall was replaced with a weaker outer eyewall, but unlike a classic ERC, Matthew did not reintensify after the inner eyewall disappeared. Triple-Doppler analysis was calculated from the NOAA P3 airborne fore and aft radar scanning combined with the KAMX radar data during the period of secondary eyewall intensification and inner eyewall weakening from 1900 UTC 6 October to 0000 UTC 7 October. Four flight passes of the P3 aircraft show the evolution of the reflectivity, tangential winds, and secondary circulation as the outer eyewall became well established. Further evolution of the ERC is analyzed from the ground-based single-Doppler radar observations for 35 h with high temporal resolution at a 5-min interval from 1900 UTC 6 October to 0000 UTC 8 October using the Generalized Velocity Track Display (GVTD) technique. The single-Doppler analyses indicate that the inner eyewall decayed a few hours after the P3 flight, while the outer eyewall contracted but did not reintensify and the asymmetries increased episodically. The analysis suggests that the ERC process was influenced by a complex combination of environmental vertical wind shear, an evolving axisymmetric secondary circulation, and an asymmetric vortex Rossby wave damping mechanism that promoted vortex resiliency despite increasing shear.
  summary: In many tropical cyclones the eyewall where the heaviest rain and winds are found is replaced by a larger outer eyewall, leading to an expansion of the damaging winds and intensity change, but this process is not well understood. Hurricane Matthew (2016) underwent an eyewall replacement that was observed by coastal and airborne radars, but in contrast to other storms was impacted by strong vertical wind shear during the process. In this study we analyze 35 h of radar data to examine Matthew’s evolution. The analyses show a complex interaction between the external vertical wind shear and the internal dynamics of the storm that weakened the storm and increased its asymmetry, improving our understanding of hurricane structure and intensity change.

    Polygonal eyewall asymmetries of Hurricane Michael (2018) during rapid intensification (RI) are analyzed from ground‐based single Doppler radar. Here, we present the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the axisymmetric and asymmetric winds at 5‐min intervals. Spectral time decomposition of the retrieved tangential wind structure shows quantitative evidence of low (1–4) azimuthal wavenumbers with propagation speeds that are consistent with linear wave theory on a radial vorticity gradient, suggesting the presence of rapidly evolving vortex Rossby waves. Dual‐Doppler winds from the NOAA P‐3 Hurricane Hunter airborne radar provide further evidence of the three‐dimensional vortex structure that supports growth of asymmetries during RI. Both reflectivity and tangential wind fields show polygonal structure and propagate at similar speeds, suggesting a close coupling of the dynamics and the convective organization during the intensification.
  summary: >
    Understanding tropical cyclone (TC) structure and evolution are crucial for improving weather forecasts. Hurricane Michael (2018) was observed by radar imagery to have an evolving polygonal eyewall with elliptical, triangular, and square shapes during rapid intensification (RI). While polygonal eyewall shapes have been seen in previous hurricanes, the corresponding evolution of wind asymmetries has never been quantitatively deduced due to limitations from previous observations. Here, we present the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the winds at 5‐min intervals from single‐Doppler Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) observations. The results highlight the value of coastal radar observations to investigate physical mechanisms of TC intensity and structure evolution and will help to improve intensity forecasts in the future.

  abstract: This study analyzes an ensemble of numerical simulations of a heavy rainfall event east of Taiwan on 9 June 2020. Heavy rainfall was produced by quasi-stationary back-building mesoscale convective systems (MCS) associated with a mei-yu front. Global model forecast skill was poor in location and intensity of rainfall. The mesoscale ensemble showed liminal conditions between heavy rainfall or little to no rainfall. The two most accurate and two least accurate ensemble members are selected for analysis via validation against radar-estimated rainfall observations. All members feature moist soundings with low levels of free convection (LFC) and sufficient instability for deep convection. We find that stronger gradients in 100-m θe and θv in the most accurate members associated with a near-surface frontal boundary focus the lifting mechanism for deep, moist convection and enhanced rainfall. As the simulations progress, stronger southerly winds in the least accurate members advect drier mid-level air into the region of interest and shift the near-surface boundary further north and west. Analysis of the verification ensemble mean analysis reveals a strong near-surface frontal boundary similarly positioned as in the most accurate members and dry air aloft more similar to that in the least accurate members, suggesting that the positioning of the frontal boundary is more critical to accurately reproducing rainfall patterns and intensity in this case. The analyses suggest that subtle details in the simulation of frontal boundaries and mesoscale flow structures can lead to bifurcations in producing extreme or almost no rainfall. Implications for improved probabilistic forecasts of heavy rainfall events will be discussed.

    to other tropical cyclones
  keypoint2: High-concentrations of midsize drops were more common and widespread
    in Harvey than in Florence
  keypoint3: Harvey's rainfall was more intense and asymmetric due to vertical wind
    shear and a weaker intensity
  abstract: Polarimetric coastal radar data are used to compare the rainfall characteristics
    of Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Florence (2018). Intense rainfall was an infrequent
    yet important contributor to the total rainfall in Harvey, but its relative contribution
    varied spatially. The total rainfall over land maximized near the coast over Beaumont,
    TX due to intense convection resulting from prolonged onshore flow downshear from
    the circulation center. Overall, polarimetric radar observations in Harvey show
    a dominance of high concentrations of small-to-medium drops, consistent with prior
    tropical cyclone studies. The microphysical characteristics were spatially and
    temporally inhomogeneous however, with larger drops more frequent on 27 August
    and higher number concentrations more frequent on 28 and 30 August. The polarimetric
    variables and raindrop characteristics observed during Florence share broad similarities
    to Harvey, but had reduced variability, fewer observations of stronger reflectivity
    and differential reflectivity, and a lower frequency of high number concentrations
    and medium-sized drops. The radar data indicate Florence had reduced coverage
    of stronger convection compared to Harvey. We hypothesize that differences in
    storm motion, intensity decay rates, and vertical wind shear produce the distinct
    precipitation structures and microphysical differences seen in Harvey and Florence.

  abstract: Convective activity in Catalonia (northeastern Spain) mainly occurs during summer and autumn, with severe weather occurring 33 days per year on average. In some cases, the storms have unexpected propagation characteristics, likely due to a combination of the complex topography and the thunderstorms’ propagation mechanisms. Partly due to the local nature of the events, numerical weather prediction models are not able to accurately nowcast the complex mesoscale mechanisms (i.e., local influence of topography). This directly impacts the retrieved position and motion of the storms, and consequently, the likely associated storm severity. Although a successful warning system based on lightning and radar observations has been developed, there remains a lack of knowledge of storm dynamics that could lead to forecast improvements. The present study explores the capabilities of the radar network at the Meteorological Service of Catalonia to retrieve dual-Doppler wind fields to study the dynamics of Catalan thunderstorms. A severe thunderstorm that splits and a tornado-producing supercell that is channeled through a valley are used to demonstrate the capabilities of an advanced open source technique that retrieves dynamical variables from C-band operational radars in complex terrain. For the first time in the Iberian Peninsula, complete 3D storm-relative winds are obtained, providing information about the internal dynamics of the storms.  This aids in the analyses of the interaction between different storm cells within a system and/or the interaction of the cells with the local topography

  abstract: Remote sensing observational instruments are critical for better understanding and predicting severe weather. Obser- vational data from such instruments, such as Doppler radar data, for example, are often processed for assimilation into numerical weather prediction models. As such instruments become more sophisticated, the amount of data to be processed grows and requires efficient variational analysis tools. Here we examine the code that implements the popular SAMURAI (Spline Analysis at Mesoscale Utilizing Radar and Aircraft Instrumentation) technique for estimating the at- mospheric state for a given set of observations. We employ a number of techniques to significantly improve the code’s performance, including porting it to run on standard HPC clusters, analyzing and optimizing its single-node performance, implementing a more efficient nonlinear optimization method, and enabling the use of GPUs via OpenACC. Our efforts thus far have yielded more than 100x improvement over the original code on large test problems of interest to the community.

  abstract: The landfall of Hurricane Michael (2018) at category-5 intensity occurred after rapid intensification (RI) spanning much of the storm’s lifetime. Four Hurricane Hunter aircraft missions observed the RI period with tail Doppler radar (TDR). Data from each of the 14 aircraft passes through the storm were quality controlled via a combination of interactive and machine-learning techniques. TDR data from each pass were synthesized using the Spline Analysis at Mesoscale Utilizing Radar and Aircraft Instrumentation (SAMURAI) variational wind retrieval technique to yield three- dimensional kinematic fields of the storm to examine inner-core processes during RI. Vorticity and angular momentum increased and concentrated in the eyewall region. A vorticity budget analysis indicates that the tendencies became more axisymmetric over time. In this study, we focus in particular on how the eyewall vorticity tower builds vertically into the upper levels. Horizontal vorticity associated with the vertical gradient of tangential wind was tilted into the vertical by the eyewall updraft to yield a positive vertical vorticity tendency inward atop the existing vorticity tower, which is further developed locally upward and outward along the sloped eyewall through advection and stretching. Observed maintenance of thermal wind balance from a thermodynamic retrieval shows evidence of a strengthening warm core, which aided in low- ering surface pressure and further contributed to the efficient intensification in the latter stages of this RI event.

  keypoint1: Anti-cyclonic wave breaking (AWB) activity is shown to be associated
    with the second leading EOF mode in tropical North Atlantic vertical wind shear
    (VWS) and accounts for 23% of the structured variance.
  keypoint2: While the tropical sources of VWS from ENSO and the AMM remain the dominant
    drivers of tropical North Atlantic VWS, the extratropical sources of VWS from
    AWB are an important contribution to tropical and subtropical VWS variability
    and tropical cyclone (TC) activity.
  keypoint3: VWS anomalies induced by AWB activity may be a suitable indicator of
    AWB impacts on VWS and its subsequent influence on seasonal TC activity.
  abstract: Given recent insights into the role of anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking
    (AWB) in driving subseasonal and seasonal North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC)
    activity, this study further examines tropical versus subtropical impacts on TC
    activity by considering large-scale influences on boreal summer tropical zonal
    vertical wind shear (VWS) variability, a key predictor of seasonal TC activity.
    Through an empirical orthogonal function analysis, it is shown that subtropical
    AWB activity drives the second mode of variability in tropical zonal VWS, while
    El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) primarily drives the leading mode of variability.
    Linear regressions of the four leading principal components against tropical North
    Atlantic zonal VWS and accumulated cyclone energy show that, while the leading
    mode holds much of the regression strength, some improvement can be achieved with
    the addition of the second and third modes. Furthermore, an index of AWB-associated
    VWS anomalies, a proxy for AWB impacts on the large-scale environment, may be
    a better indicator of summertime VWS anomalies. The utilization of this index
    may be used to better understand AWB’s contribution to seasonal TC activity.

  abstract: In this study, we examine the wintertime environmental precursors of summer anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) over the North Atlantic region and assess the applicability of these precursors in predicting AWB impacts on sea- sonal tropical cyclone (TC) activity. We show that predictors representing the environmental impacts of subtropical AWB on seasonal TC activity improve the skill of extended-range seasonal forecasts of TC activity. There is a significant correla- tion between boreal winter and boreal summer AWB activity via AWB-forced phases of the quasi-stationary North Atlan- tic Oscillation (NAO). Years with above-normal boreal summer AWB activity over the North Atlantic region also show above-normal AWB activity in the preceding boreal winter that tends to force a positive phase of the NAO that persists through the spring. These conditions are sustained by continued AWB throughout the year, particularly when El Nin ̃o–Southern Oscillation plays less of a role at forcing the large-scale circulation. While individual AWB events are syn- optic and nonlinear with little predictability beyond 8–10 days, the strong dynamical connection between winter and sum- mer wave breaking lends enough persistence to AWB activity to enable predictability of its potential impacts on TC activity. We find that the winter–summer relationship improves the skill of extended-range seasonal forecasts from as early as an April lead time, particularly for years when wave breaking has played a crucial role in suppressing TC development.

  abstract: The parametric hurricane rainfall model (PHRaM), firstly introduced in 2007, has been widely used to forecast and quantify tropical- cyclone-induced rainfall (TC rainfall). The PHRaM is much more computationally efficient than global climate models, but PHRaM cannot be effectively utilized in the context of climate change because it does not have any parameters to capture the increase of tropospheric water vapor under the warming world. This study develops a new model that incorporates tropospheric water vapor to the PHRaM framework, named as the PHRaM with moisture (PHRaMM). The PHRaMM is trained to best fit the TC rainfall over the western North Pacific (WNP) unlike the PHRaM trained with the TCs over the continental US. The PHRaMM reliably simulates radial profile of TC rainfall and spatial distribution of accumulated rainfall during landfall in the present climate with the better prediction skills than existing statistical and operational numerical models. Using the PHRaMM, we evaluated the impacts of TC intensity and environmental moisture increase on TC rainfall change in a future climate. An increased TC intensity causes TC rainfall to increase in the inner-core region but to decrease in the outer region, whereas an increased environmental moisture causes the TC rainfall to increase over the entire TC area. According to the both effects of increased TC intensity and environmental moisture, the PHRaMM projected that the WNP TC rainfall could increase by 4.61–8.51% in the inner-core region and by 17.96–20.91% over the entire TC area under the 2-K warming scenario.

  abstract: Colorado State University (CSU) has been issuing seasonal hurricane forecasts since 1984, with statistical modeling techniques primarily underpinning these outlooks. CSU has recently begun issuing statistical/dynamical forecasts, using the SEAS5 forecast system from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts to forecast the three predictors that currently comprise CSU's early August statistical forecast model. SEAS5 shows skill at forecasting all three of these July predictors from an initialization as early as 1 March. The SEAS5 model forecasts for the three parameters are then regressed against seasonal accumulated cyclone energy. The model has a cross‐validated correlation skill of r = 0.60 with accumulated cyclone energy for a 1 March initialization, improving to r = 0.67 for a 1 June initialization over the period from 1982–2019. The combination of the statistical/dynamical model with the currently existing statistical models shows improved skill over either model individually for the April, June, and July outlooks.
  summary: The Tropical Meteorology Project at Colorado State University (CSU), founded by the late Dr. William Gray, has been issuing seasonal Atlantic basin hurricane forecasts since 1984. These forecasts have primarily used statistical modeling approaches that take historical relationships between Atlantic hurricane activity and various climate features, such as El Niño‐Southern Oscillation and tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures. In this study, we use the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts System 5 (SEAS5) model to forecast the three large‐scale predictors that currently comprise the early August statistical hurricane forecast model used by CSU. SEAS5 shows skill at forecasting each of these predictors during July from initialization as early as 1 March. The forecasted predictors from the dynamical model are then used to make a statistical forecast of accumulated cyclone energy—an integrated metric accounting for intensity and duration of hurricane activity. The model shows skill at predicting accumulated cyclone energy at all lead times, with improving skill as the lead time decreases. The combination of CSU's currently existing statistical models and the statistical/dynamical models detailed in this manuscript shows improved skill over either model individually for the early April, June, and July outlooks, with the most notable improvement in early April.

  abstract: The active 2020 Atlantic hurricane season produced 30 named storms, 14 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes (category 3+ on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale). Though the season was active overall, the final two months (October–November) raised 2020 into the upper echelon of Atlantic hurricane activity for integrated metrics such as accumulated cyclone energy (ACE). This study focuses on October–November 2020, when 7 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes formed and produced ACE of 74 × 104 kt2 (1 kt ≈ 0.51 m s−1). Since 1950, October–November 2020 ranks tied for third for named storms, first for hurricanes and major hurricanes, and second for ACE. Six named storms also underwent rapid intensification (≥30 kt intensification in ≤24 h) in October–November 2020—the most on record. This manuscript includes a climatological analysis of October–November tropical cyclones (TCs) and their primary formation regions. In 2020, anomalously low wind shear in the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, likely driven by a moderate-intensity La Niña event and anomalously high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Caribbean, provided dynamic and thermodynamic conditions that were much more conducive than normal for late-season TC formation and rapid intensification. This study also highlights October–November 2020 landfalls, including Hurricanes Delta and Zeta in Louisiana and in Mexico and Hurricanes Eta and Iota in Nicaragua. The active late season in the Caribbean would have been anticipated by a statistical model using the July–September-averaged ENSO longitude index and Atlantic warm pool SSTs as predictors.

  keypoint1: Global hurricane counts and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) have significantly decreased since 1990 likely due to a trend toward La Niña
  keypoint2: Short-lived named storms, extreme rapid intensification events (50+ kt day−1) and global damage have increased significantly from 1990 to 2021
  keypoint3: Decreasing trend in global hurricanes and ACE is primarily driven by downturn in western North Pacific activity
  abstract: This study investigates global tropical cyclone (TC) activity trends from 1990 to 2021, a period marked by largely consistent observational platforms. Several global TC metrics have decreased during this period, with significant decreases in hurricane numbers and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE). Most of this decrease has been driven by significant downward trends in the western North Pacific. Globally, short- lived named storms, 24-hr intensification events of ≥50 kt day−1, and TC-related damage have increased significantly. The increase in short-lived named storms is likely due to technological improvements, while rapidly intensifying TC increases may be fueled by higher potential intensity. Damage increases are largely due to increased coastal assets. The significant decrease in hurricane numbers and global ACE are likely due to the trend toward a more La Niña-like base state from 1990 to 2021, favoring North Atlantic TC activity and suppressing North and South Pacific TC activity.
  summary: This study investigates 1990–2021 global tropical cyclone (TC) activity trends, a period characterized by consistent satellite observing platforms. We find that fewer hurricanes are occurring globally and that the tropics are producing less Accumulated Cyclone Energy—a metric accounting for hurricane frequency, intensity, and duration. This decreasing trend has primarily been driven by a significant downturn in western North Pacific TC activity—the tropical basin that typically is the most active. Short-lived named storms (TCs lasting ≤2 days) and the number of times that TCs quickly strengthen (≥50 kt in 24 hr) have increased significantly since 1990. Identifying more short-lived named storms is likely due to improved sensors, while increases in rapidly intensifying storms may be driven by more favorable conditions. Global damage from TCs has significantly increased as well, likely largely due to population growth and increased value of coastal assets (physical structures and non-physical risk exposure). The trend during the past 32 years toward a more La Niña-like environment has favored North Atlantic TC activity and suppressed North and South Pacific activity. Since the Pacific Ocean normally generates much more activity than the Atlantic, global TC activity has generally trended downward.

  keypoint1: Minimum sea level pressure better predicts continental US hurricane damage than maximum winds or integrated kinetic energy
  keypoint2: Maximum winds have historically been a poor predictor of damage caused by hurricanes making landfall from Georgia to Maine
  keypoint3: Minimum sea level pressure is intrinsically an integrated wind field metric and is easy to measure, ideal for categorizing hurricane risk
  abstract: The damage potential of a hurricane is widely considered to depend more strongly on an integrated measure of the hurricane wind field, such as integrated kinetic energy (IKE), than a point-based wind measure, such as maximum sustained wind speed (Vmax). Recent work has demonstrated that minimum sea levelpressure (MSLP) is also an integrated measure of the wind field. This study investigates how well historical continental US hurricane damage is predicted by MSLP compared to both Vmax and IKE for continental United States hurricane landfalls for the period 1988–2021. We first show for the entire North Atlantic basin that MSLP is much better correlated with IKE (rrank = 0.50) than Vmax (rrank = 0.26). We then show that continental US hurricane normalized damage is better predicted by MSLP (rrank = 0.83) than either Vmax (rrank = 0.67) or IKE (rrank = 0.65). For Georgia to Maine hurricane landfalls specifically, MSLP and IKE show similar levels of skill at predicting damage, whereas Vmax provides effectively no predictive power. Conclusions for IKE extend to power dissipation as well, as the two quantities are highly correlated because wind radii closely follow a Modified Rankine vortex. The physical relationship of MSLP to IKE and power dissipation is discussed. In addition to better representing damage, MSLP is also much easier to measure via aircraft or surface observations than either V or IKE, and it is already routinely estimated operationally. We conclude that max MSLP is an ideal metric for characterizing hurricane damage risk.
  summary: For decades, maximum sustained winds have been used to categorize potential hurricane impacts. Recent work argues that an integrated hurricane wind field measure better represents risk. Here we use historical continental US hurricane and economic damage data to show that minimum sea level pressure better correlates with damage than integrated kinetic energy, a measure of hurricane vortex size and strength, or maximum sustained wind. Maximum sustained wind has been a poor damage predictor for Georgia to Maine landfalling hurricanes. Since minimum central pressure is an integrated wind field measure that only requires storm center measurements, and is already routinely estimated, we propose that minimum sea level pressure replace maximum sustained wind as the primary hurricane categorization method.

  keypoint1: The 1933 Atlantic hurricane season was extremely active, rivaling or exceeding the infamous 2005 season for several tropical cyclone parameters
  keypoint2: Large-scale environmental conditions in 1933 were very favorable, with warm tropical Atlantic SSTs and reduced vertical wind shear
  keypoint3: Current June and August statistical forecast models from CSU well-anticipated the heightened levels of activity observed in 1933
  abstract: "The 1933 Atlantic hurricane season was extremely active, with 20 named storms and 11 hurricanes including 6 major hurricanes occurring. The 1933 hurricane season also generated the most Accumulated Cyclone Energy (an integrated metric that accounts for frequency, intensity, and duration) of any Atlantic hurricane season on record. A total of 8 hurricanes tracked through the Caribbean in 1933, the most on record. In addition, two Category 3 hurricanes made landfall in the United States just 23 hours apart:: the Treasure Coast hurricane in southeast Florida followed by the CubaBrownsville hurricane in south Texas.

This manuscript examines large-scale atmospheric and oceanic conditions that likely led to such an active hurricane season. Extremely weak vertical wind shear was prevalent over both the Caribbean and the tropical Atlantic throughout the peak months of the hurricane season, likely in part due to a weak-to-moderate La Niña event. These favorable dynamic conditions, combined with above-normal tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures, created a very conducive environment for hurricane formation and intensification. The Madden-Julian oscillation was relatively active during the summer and fall of 1933, providing sub-seasonal conditions that were quite favorable for tropical cyclogenesis during mid-to-late August and late September to early October. The current early June and August statistical models used by Colorado State University would have predicted a very active 1933 hurricane season. A better understanding of these extremely active historical Atlantic hurricane seasons may aid in anticipation of future hyperactive seasons.
  summary: The Tropical Meteorology Project at Colorado State University (CSU), founded by the late Dr. William Gray, has been issuing seasonal Atlantic basin hurricane forecasts since 1984. These forecasts have primarily used statistical modeling approaches that take historical relationships between Atlantic hurricane activity and various climate features, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation and tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures. In this study, we use the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts System 5 (SEAS5) model to forecast the three large-scale predictors that currently comprise the early August statistical hurricane forecast model used by CSU. SEAS5 shows skill at forecasting each of these predictors during July from initialization as early as 1 March. The forecasted predictors from the dynamical model are then used to make a statistical forecast of Accumulated Cyclone Energy - an integrated metric accounting for intensity and duration of hurricane activity. The model shows skill at predicting Accumulated Cyclone Energy at all lead times, with improving skill as the lead time decreases. The combination of CSU’s currently-existing statistical models and the statistical/dynamical models detailed in this manuscript shows improved skill over either model individually for the early April, June and July outlooks, with the most notable improvement in early April."

    hurricane damage for the continental US from 1900-2018
  keypoint2: Pressure is more akin to an integrated metric than is maximum sustained

  abstract: Atlantic hurricane seasons have a long history of causing significant
    financial impacts, with Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, and Michael combining to
    incur more than 345 billion USD in direct economic damage during 2017-2018.  While
    Michael’s damage was primarily wind and storm surge-driven, Florence’s and Harvey’s
    damage was predominantly rainfall and inland flood-driven.  Several revised scales
    have been proposed to replace the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS),
    which currently only categorizes the hurricane wind threat, while not explicitly
    handling the totality of storm impacts including storm surge and rainfall. However,
    most of these newly-proposed scales are not easily calculated in real-time, nor
    can they be reliably calculated historically. In particular, they depend on storm
    wind radii, which remain very uncertain. Herein, we analyze the relationship between
    normalized historical damage caused by continental United States (CONUS) landfalling
    hurricanes from 1900-2018 with both maximum sustained wind speed (Vmax) and minimum
    sea level pressure (MSLP).  We show that MSLP is a more skillful predictor of
    normalized damage than Vmax, with a significantly higher rank correlation between
    normalized damage and MSLP (rrank = 0.77) than between normalized damage and Vmax
    (rrank = 0.66) for all CONUS landfalling hurricanes.  MSLP has served as a much
    better predictor of hurricane damage in recent years than Vmax, with large hurricanes
    such as Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012) causing much more damage than anticipated
    from their SSHWS ranking. MSLP is also a more accurately-measured quantity than
    is Vmax, making it an ideal quantity for evaluating a hurricane’s potential damage.

  # Abstract of the paper.
  abstract: Observations from the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in
    the Tropics (PREDICT), Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), and
    Intensity Forecast Experiment (IFEX) field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010). Research aircraft missions provided Doppler radar, in situ flight level,
    and dropsonde data documenting the structural changes of the predepression disturbance.
    Following the pre-Karl wave pouch, variational analyses at the meso-β and meso-α
    scales suggest that the convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and
    midlevel circulations leading to genesis episodically rather than through a sustained
    lowering of the convective mass flux from increased stabilization. Convective
    bursts that erupt in the vorticity-rich environment of the recirculating pouch
    region enhance the low-level meso-β- and meso-α-scale circulation through vortex
    stretching. As the convection wanes, the resulting stratiform precipitation strengthens
    the midlevel circulation through convergence associated with ice microphysical
    processes, protecting the disturbance from the intrusion of dry environmental
    air. Once the column saturation fraction returns to a critical value, a subsequent
    convective burst below the midlevel circulation further enhances the low-level
    circulation, and the convective cycle repeats. The analyses suggest that the onset
    of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely related to the
    coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels. Our interpretation
    of the observational analysis presented in this study reaffirms a primary role
    of deep convection in the genesis process and provides a hypothesis for the supporting
    role of stratiform precipitation and the midlevel vortex.

  keypoint1: This manuscript examines the relationship between the QBO and the MJO
    during the boreal winter and finds that the strong relationship observed in recent
    years did not exist prior to the mid 1970s.  We hypothesize that climate change
    has strengthened the relationship between the MJO and QBO.

  abstract: A strong relationship between the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of
    equatorial stratospheric winds and the amplitude of the Madden-Julian oscillation
    (MJO) during the boreal winter has recently been uncovered using observational
    data from the mid-1970s to the present. When the QBO is in its easterly phase
    in the lower stratosphere, it favors stronger MJO activity during boreal winter,
    while the MJO tends to be weaker during the westerly phase of the QBO. Here we
    show using reconstructed indices of the MJO and QBO back to 1905 that the relationship
    between enhanced boreal winter MJO activity and the easterly phase of the QBO
    has only emerged since the early 1980s. The emergence of this relationship coincides
    with the recent cooling trend in the equatorial lower stratosphere and the warming
    trend in the equatorial upper troposphere, which appears to have sensitized MJO
    convective activity to QBO-induced changes in static stability near the tropopause.
    Climate change is thus suggested to have played a role in promoting coupling between
    the MJO and the QBO.

  abstract: This paper summarizes the forecast methods, outputs and skill offered
    by twelve agencies for seasonal tropical cyclone (TC) activity around the world.
    These agencies use a variety of techniques ranging from statistical models to
    dynamical models to predict basinwide activity and regional activity. In addition,
    several dynamical and hybrid statistical/dynamical models now predict TC track
    density as well as landfall likelihood. Realtime Atlantic seasonal hurricane forecasts
    have shown low skill in April, modest skill in June and good skill in August at
    predicting basinwide TC activity when evaluated over 2003-2018. Real-time western
    North Pacific seasonal TC forecasts have shown good skill by July for basinwide
    intense typhoon numbers and the ACE index when evaluated for 2003-2018. Both hindcasts
    and real-time forecasts have shown skill for other TC basins. A summary of recent
    research into forecasting TC activity beyond seasonal (e.g., multi-year) timescales
    is included. Recommendations for future areas of research are also discussed.

  abstract: "Understanding and quantifying air-sea exchanges of enthalpy and momentum fluxes are crucial for the advanced prediction of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity. Here, we present a new parameterization of air-sea fluxes at extreme wind speeds from 40 m s−1 to 75 m s−1, which covers the range of major TCs. Our approach assumes that the TC can reach its maximum potential intensity (MPI) if there are no influences of external forces such as vertical wind shear or other environmental constraints.This method can estimate the ratio of the enthalpy and momentum exchange coefficient (Ck/Cd) under the most intense TCs without direct flux measurements. The estimation showed that Ck/Cd increases with wind speed at extreme winds above 40 m s−1. Two types of surface layer schemes of the Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) were designed based on the wind speed dependency of the Ck/Cd found at high winds: (i) an increase of Ck/Cd based on decreasing Cd (Cd_DC) and (ii) an increase of Ck/Cd based on increasing Ck (Ck_IC). The modified surface layer schemes were compared to the original HWRF scheme (using nearly fixed Cd and Ck at extreme winds; CTRL) through idealized experiments and real-case predictions. The idealized experiments showed that Cd_DC reduced frictional dissipation in the air-sea interface as well as significantly reduced sea surface cooling, making the TC stronger than other schemes. As a result, Cd_DC reduced the mean absolute error and negative bias by 15.0% (21.0%) and 19.1% (32.0%), respectively, for all lead times of Hurricane Irma in 2017 (Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018) compared to CTRL. This result suggests that new parameterization of Ck/Cd with decreasing Cd at high winds can help improve TC intensity prediction, which currently suffers from underestimating the intensity of the strongest TCs."

  abstract: Observations of the air vertical velocities (wair) in supercell updrafts are presented, including uncertainty estimates, from radiosonde GPS measurements in two supercells. These in situ observations were collected during the Colorado State University Convective CLoud Outflows and UpDrafts Experiment (C3 15 LOUD-Ex) in moderately unstable environments in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. Based on the radiosonde accelerations, instances when the radiosonde balloon likely burst within the updraft are determined, and adjustments are made to account for the subsequent reduction in radiosonde buoyancy. Before and after these adjustments, the maximum estimated wair values are 36.2 and 49.9 m s-1 19 , respectively. Radar data are used to contextualize the in situ observations and suggest that most of the radiosonde observations were located several kilometers away from the most intense vertical motions. Therefore, the radiosonde-based wair values presented likely underestimate the maximum values within these storms due to these sampling biases, as well as the impacts from hydrometeors, which are not accounted for. When possible, radiosonde-based wair values were compared to estimates from dual-Doppler methods and from parcel theory. When the radiosondes observed their highest wair values, dual-Doppler methods generally produced 15-20 m s-1 26 lower wair for the same location, which could be related to the differences in the observing systems’ resolutions. In situ observations within supercell updrafts, which have been limited in recent decades, can be used to improve our understanding and modeling of storm dynamics. This study provides new in situ observations, as well as methods and lessons that could be applied to future field campaigns.

  keypoint1: Patricia's structure was predominantly characterized by a hollow potential vorticity tower during its rapid intensification.
  keypoint2: Symmetric heating remained fixed to the same absolute angular momentum surfaces as they contracted in physical space, contributing to a rapid concentration of potential vorticity.
  keypoint3: Patricia's rapid over-water weakening was charactized by a dilution of the hollow potential vorticity tower and eddy mixing near the eye and eyewall region.
  abstract: Operational numerical models failed to predict the record-setting rapid intensification and rapid over-water weakening of Hurricane Patricia (2015) in the eastern North Pacific basin, resulting in large intensity forecast errors. In an effort to better understand the mesoscale processes contributing to Patricia's rapid intensity changes, we analyze high-resolution aircraft observations collected on 22-23 October. Spline-based variational analyses are created from observations collected via in situ measurements, Doppler radar, and full-tropospheric dropsonde profiles as part of the Office of Naval Research Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI) experiment and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Intensity Forecasting Experiment (IFEX). We present the first full-tropospheric calculation of the dry, axisymmetric Ertel's potential vorticity (PV) in a tropical cyclone without relying on balance assumptions. Detailed analyses reveal the formation of a "hollow tower" PV structure as Patricia rapidly approached its maximum intensity, and a subsequent breakdown of this structure during Patricia's rapid over-water weakening phase. Transforming the axisymmetric PV analyses from radius-height to potential radius-isentropic coordinates reveals that Patricia's rapid intensification was closely related to the distribution of diabatic heating and eddy mixing. During Patricia's rapid over-water weakening phase, eddy mixing processes are hypothesized to be the primary factor rearranging the PV distribution near the eye-eyewall region, diluting the PV previously confined to the hollow tower while approximately conserving the absolute circulation.

  abstract: Scale-dependent processes within the tropical cyclone (TC) eyewall and their contributions to intensifica- tion are examined in an idealized simulation of a TC translating in uniform environmental flow. The TC circulation is parti- tioned into axisymmetric, low-wavenumber (m = 1–3), and high-wavenumber (m . 3) categories, and scale-dependent contributions to the intensification process are quantified through the azimuthal-mean relative (vertical) vorticity and tan- gential momentum budgets. To further account for the interdependent relationship between the axisymmetric vortex struc- ture and eyewall asymmetries, the analyses are subdivided into three periods}early, middle, and late}that represent the approximate quartiles of the full intensification period prior to the TC attaining its maximum intensity. The asymmetries become concentrated among lower azimuthal wavenumbers during the intensification process and are persistently distrib- uted among a broader range of azimuthal scales at higher altitudes. The scale-dependent budgets demonstrate that the axi- symmetric and asymmetric processes generally oppose each other during TC intensification. The axisymmetric processes are mostly characterized by a radial spinup dipole pattern, with a tangential momentum spinup tendency concentrated along the radius of maximum tangential winds (RMW) and a spindown tendency concentrated radially inward of the RMW. The asymmetric processes are mostly characterized by an opposing spindown dipole pattern that is slightly weaker in magnitude. The most salient exception occurs from high-wavenumber processes contributing to a relatively modest, net spinup along the RMW between ∼2- and 4-km altitude. Given that the maximum tangential winds persistently reside below 2-km altitude, eyewall asymmetries are primarily found to impede TC intensification.
  summary: The convection fueling a tropical cyclone progressively organizes into a compact region called the eyewall where the strongest winds and rainfall occur. As the tropical cyclone intensifies, convection in the circular eyewall becomes more uniform, and the eyewall takes the appearance of a ring. We call this ring shape the “symmetric” part of the eyewall. As convection in the eyewall evolves and interacts, the eyewall becomes deformed and develops wiggles. We call these wiggly shapes the “asymmetric” parts of the eyewall. We demonstrate that the sym- metric part of the eyewall helps intensification. The asymmetric parts of the eyewall mostly hurt intensification except during the earlier stages. Our results indicate that a symmetric eyewall shape is preferable for tropical cyclone intensification.

  keypoint1: Structural differences are observed in tropical cyclone composites organaized by intensity, intensity change, age, and the presence of a secondary wind maximum.
  keypoint2: Intensifying tropical cyclones are distinguished from their steady-state and weakening counterparts by the presence of a vorticity ring structure, higher inner- and outer-core moisture, and a notably drier eye.
  keypoint3: Structural differences in the tangential wind profiles of minor hurricanes are predominant in the inner-core region during the early life cycle whereas structural differences in the tangential wind profiles of major hurricanes are predominant in the outer-core region during the late life cycle.
  abstract: A comprehensive examination of tropical cyclone (TC) kinematic and thermodynamic structure in the Atlantic basin is created from the Extended Flight Level Dataset (FLIGHT+) for Tropical Cyclones (Version 1.1). In situ data collected at the 700-hPa flight level by NOAA WP-3D and USAF WC-130 aircraft from 1999 to 2012 are analyzed. A total of 233 azimuthal mean profiles comprising 1498 radial legs are stratified by TC intensity and 12-hour intensity change. A matrix of composite structures is created for minor (category 1 and 2) and major (category 3 and above) hurricanes that are intensifying [intensity increase greater than or equal to 10 kt in 12 h], steady-state [intensity change between +/- 5 kt in 12 h], and weakening [intensity decrease less than or equal to -10 kt in 12 h]. Additional considerations to the impacts of age on TC structure are given as well. Axisymmetric radial composites reveal that intensifying TCs have statistically significant structural differences from TCs that are steady-state or weakening, but that these differences also depend on the intensity of the TC. Intensifying TCs (both minor and major hurricanes) are characterized by steep tangential wind gradients radially inward of the radius of maximum tangential wind (RMW) that contributes to a ring-like structure of vorticity and inertial stability. Tangential wind structural differences are more pronounced in the eye of minor hurricanes compared to major hurricanes. Intensifying TCs are found to have higher inner and outer-core moisture compared to steady-state and weakening TCs. Furthermore, intensifying major hurricanes possess drier eyes compared to steady-state and weakening major hurricanes.

  abstract: This study investigates the contributions of incipient vortex circulation and midlevel moisture to tropical cyclone (TC) expansion within an idealized numerical modeling framework. We find that the incipient vortex circulation places the primary constraint on TC expansion. Increasing the midlevel moisture further promotes expansion but mostly expedites the intensification process. The expansion rate for initially large vortices exhibits a stronger response to increasing the midlevel moisture compared to initially small vortices. Previous studies have noted a proclivity for relatively small TCs to stay small and relatively large TCs to stay large; that is, TCs possess a sort of “memory” with respect to their incipient circulation. We reproduce this finding with an independent modeling framework and further demonstrate that an initially large vortex can expand more quickly than its relatively smaller counterpart; therefore, with all other factors contributing to expansion held constant, the contrast in size between the two vortices will increase with time. Varying the incipient vortex circulation is associated with subsequent variations in the amount and scale of outer‐core convection. As the incipient vortex circulation decreases, outer‐core convection is relatively scarce and characterized by small‐scale, isolated convective elements. On the contrary, as the incipient vortex circulation increases, outer‐core convection abounds and is characterized by relatively large rainbands and mesoscale convective systems. A combined increase in the amount and scale of outer‐core convection permits an initially large vortex to converge a substantially greater amount of absolute angular momentum compared to its relatively smaller counterpart, resulting in distinct expansion rates.
  summary: A variety of atmospheric and oceanic processes contribute to the expansion of a tropical cyclone wind field. We examine a subset of factors with idealized simulations to better understand how tropical cyclones expand. When both the initial size of a tropical cyclone and the environmental moisture are varied in accordance with observations, we find that the initial size of a tropical cyclone places the primary constraint on the expansion of a tropical cyclone wind field. We verify that tropical cyclones possess “memory” of their size when they first developed such that a small tropical cyclone stays small and a large tropical cyclone stays large. We further demonstrate that large tropical cyclones can expand more quickly than their relatively smaller counterparts. The amount of moisture in the atmosphere modulates the expansion of a tropical cyclone wind field. A relatively moist environment facilitates the development of convection and a concomitant increase of wind speeds that contributes to an expansion of the tropical cyclone wind field. Our findings motivate additional research investigating the variability of processes contributing to the initial size of a tropical cyclone amidst Earth's warming climate system.

  abstract: 'Several previous studies on tropical cyclone (TC) risk assessment have attempted to quantify the relationship between TC damage and its elements (i.e. exposure, vulnerability, and hazard). For hazard parameters, TC intensity (e.g. central minimum pressure, maximum wind speed) and size information (e.g. 30 knot radius of the TC) have been widely utilized. Our risk analysis of 85 TCs that made landfall in South Korea from 1979 to 2010, however, suggests that a small deviation of the TC track in the west–east direction (≤250 km, smaller than the average radius of TC) has a more dominant effect on the extent and distribution of TC damage than TC intensity or size. This significant track dependency of TC damage exists because the TC track is responsible for the realization of hazard change from potential to active. More specifically, although two TCs may have the same intensity and size, locally experienced rainfall and wind speed can vary according to their tracks due to topography. These results suggest that track information should be considered more carefully in assessments of future TC risk.'

  abstract: >
    The impact of vertical wind shear (VWS) on cyclogenesis is examined from the synoptic to meso scales using airborne Doppler radar observations of pre-depression Hagupit during Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 (TCS08) / THORPEX Pacific Area Regional Campaign (T-PARC) field campaigns. The high temporal and spatial resolution observations reveal complex localized convective and vortical characteristics of a pre-depression in a sheared environment. Pre-depression Hagupit interacted with an upper-tropospheric trough during the observation period. The strong deep-layer VWS (> 20 m s -1) had a negative impact on the development through misalignment of the low and mid-level circulations and dry air intrusion. However, the low-level circulation persisted and the system ultimately formed into a tropical cyclone after it left the high-shear zone. Here we propose that a key process that enabled the predepression to survive through the upper-tropospheric trough interaction was persistent vorticity amplification on the meso-gamma scale that was aggregated on the mesoalpha scale within the pouch. Multi-Doppler wind analysis indicates that cumulus congestus tilted the low-level horizontal vorticity into the vertical in the early stage of convective life-cycle, followed by stretching from maturing deep convection. Variations in low-level VWS on the meso-beta scale affect convective organization and horizontal vorticity generation. The results provide new insights into multi-scale processes during TC genesis and the interactions of a pre-depression with VWS at various spatial scales.

  abstract: "Heavy rainfall is a challenge to forecast due to the variety of rainfall intensities and durations across a wide spectrum of high-impact storm types. In this study, we analyze extreme storms in Tropical and Subtropical East Asia, a moisture-rich environment with complex terrain and oceanic regions. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's Precipitation Radar is utilized to characterize the frequency and rainfall intensity of four extreme storm types. Extreme storms producing heavy precipitation are categorized into four types: deep convective cores (DCCs), deepwide convective cores (DWCCs), wide convective cores (WCCs), and broad stratiforms regions (BSRs). DCCs and DWCCs occur more frequently and produce stronger rain intensities over land compared to those over ocean. However, WCCs and BSRs occur more frequently over oceans, especially in association with the Meiyu front season and climatological progression in the northern subregions. Although the Convective Cores show higher rain intensities than the BSRs, they show lower volumetric rain rate due to their comparatively smaller horizontal area. An ingredients-based framework is applied to find key similarities across the different heavy rainfall-producing storms near Taiwan using ERA5 reanalysis. The analysis shows that the broader systems (i.e., WCCs and BSRs) are associated with larger in area and longer timescales of vertical moisture flux and low-level wind shear that support the development of the horizontally large, organized storms. Smaller DCCs do not show strong vertical moisture flux on the spatial scales resolved by the reanalysis, suggesting their more local nature and less meso- or synoptic scale support."
  summary: Heavy rainfall is a challenge to forecast due to the variety of rainfall intensities and durations across a wide spectrum of high-impact storm types. In this study, we analyze extreme storms in Tropical and Subtropical East Asia (TSEA), a moisture-rich environment with complex terrain and oceanic regions. Observations from the first satellite precipitation radar are used to characterize the nature of extreme storms. Results show that deep convective storms occur more frequently over land, while the wide convective storms and the broad stratiform regions occur more frequently over oceans, especially in association with the Meiyu front (pre-East Asian monsoon season) in northern TSEA. Broad stratiform regions can produce a larger total rainfall amount compared to the convective rain categories because of larger areas. A goal of this study is to identify similar key ingredients across different extreme storm types near Taiwan. Analysis shows that the broader storms are associated with moisture in larger areas and on longer timescales, and also low-level wind shear that supports the development of the large, organized storms. Smaller deep convective storms do not show strong moisture signals in coarse-scale environmental analysis, suggesting that this storm type might need more small-scale moisture support.

  abstract: 'On average, three tropical cyclones (TCs) affect the Republic of Korea each year, causing extensive
  damage. To alleviate the TC-induced disasters, the Korean government has invested nearly 4% of its
  annual budget in recent decades in prevention efforts; however, the effectiveness of this costly
  program has not been evaluated. This study determined whether any evidence shows a reduced
  vulnerability to TCs in Korea over 1979–2010 by utilizing multi-linear regression. Homelessness,
  casualties, and property losses were individually examined. These explained variables were normalized
  into the socio-economic circumstances of 2005 before the regression to eliminate the effect of
  changing exposure by dealing with population and wealth at provincial levels. Three potential
  explanatory variables based on nationwide weather-station data were considered, including the
  maximum wind, maximum rainfall, and number of affected stations over each TC’s damaging period.
  In addition, the annual per capita income, showing a quasi-linear increasing tendency, was used as an
  additional explanatory variable to examine how vulnerability is altered. The results revealed that each
  empirical model of homelessness, casualties, and property losses can account for 47%, 57%, and 57%
  of each variance, respectively, which is highest when considering all four explanatory variables.
  Consistently negative coefficients of the per capita income terms for all damage types suggest that the
  vulnerability to TCs has been significantly reduced. This finding appears to be partly the result of the
  national prevention effort, although it also can be attributed to other unintended adaptation factors,
  such as building codes, industrial structures, and land use.'

  abstract: 'To alleviate enormous socioeconomic damages by tropical cyclones (TCs), the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) retains a special warning system for strong TCs (STCs, maximum wind speed of the best-track data ≥17 m s−1), but not for relatively weak TCs (WTCs) which are not regarded as threatening as STCs; the warning system encompasses complex extreme phenomena such as gust, downpour, storm surge, and wind wave possibly arising from STCs. However, it is necessary to examine if WTCs can be actually as harmful as STCs with various extreme phenomena. Here, we compare the risks and intensities of WTCs with those of STCs for each province by analyzing the national damage reports and the near-surface wind and rainfall records from 60 weather stations in the Republic of Korea. According to our result, WTCs bring huge damages comparable to STCs in the northwestern Korea, the most populated and the richest area in the country, while WTCs cause much less destruction than STCs in the southeast. The large damages in the northwestern Korea can be explained by different mean landfall locations between WTCs and STCs; the storm centers of WTCs make landfall closer to the northwestern coastline than STCs’. Significant correlations between wind/rainfall and the damage amount by WTCs suggest that WTCs can also induce multiple extreme phenomena like STCs. Thus, the KMA needs to develop a special warning system for WTCs like for STCs.'

  abstract: In high‐resolution numerical modeling, cloud microphysics schemes can affect the forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) by controlling the phase changes of water. The simulated TC characteristics such as motion, intensity, and structure can change depending on the number of hydrometeors used in these schemes. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of real‐time track and intensity forecasts of TCs to cloud microphysics schemes using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. For the sensitivity test, we selected WRF‐single‐moment‐microphysics Class 3 (WSM3) and Class 6 (WSM6) schemes as simple and sophisticated schemes, respectively. A total of 20 forecasts for 10 TCs were conducted. For TCs moving westward in the subtropics, track forecasts were similar in the different sensitivity tests, although the WSM6 scheme considerably reduced the TC intensity errors. However, for TCs moving to the midlatitudes, the WSM6 scheme improved both track and intensity prediction compared to the WSM3 scheme. Particularly, track errors were prominently reduced by the WSM6 scheme, which realistically captured westward shifted track during the rapid intensification process. This can be attributed to the improved simulations of TC intensity, size, and associated β effect by WSM6 scheme. In contrast, the WSM3 scheme underestimated the above characteristics due to low latent heat release compared to the WSM6 scheme. Consequently, TC track moving northwestward was unreasonably shifted eastward. This indicates that a sophisticated cloud microphysics scheme is necessary to improve the track and intensity forecasts for TCs moving to the midlatitudes.

  abstract: Hurricane Matthew locally generated more than 400 mm of rainfall on 8–9 October 2016 over the eastern Carolinas and Virginia as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The heaviest precipitation occurred along a swath situated up to 100–200 km inland from the coast and collocated with enhanced low-tropospheric frontogenesis. Analyses from version 3 of the Rapid Refresh (RAPv3) model indicate that rapid frontogenesis occurred over eastern North and South Carolina and Virginia on 8 October, largely over a 12-h time period between 1200 UTC 8 October and 0000 UTC 9 October. The heaviest rainfall in Matthew occurred when and where spiral rainbands intersected the near-surface front, which promoted the lift of conditionally unstable, moist air. Parallel to the spiral rainbands, conditionally unstable low-tropospheric warm, moist oceanic air was advected inland, and the instability was apparently released as the warm air mass rose over the front. Precipitation in the spiral rainbands intensified on 9 October as the temperature gradient along the near-surface front rapidly increased. Unlike in Hurricane Floyd over the mid-Atlantic states, rainfall totals within the spiral rainbands of Matthew as they approached the near-surface front evidently were not enhanced by release of conditional symmetric instability. However, conditional symmetric instability release in the midtroposphere may have enhanced rainfall 200 km northwest of the near-surface front. Finally, although weak cold-air damming occurred prior to heavy rainfall, damming dissipated prior to frontogenesis and did not impact rainfall totals.

  abstract: Hurricane Ophelia (2005) underwent an unconventional eyewall replacement cycle (ERC) as it was a category-1 storm located over cold sea surface temperatures near 23°C. The ERC was analyzed using airborne radar, flight-level, and dropsonde data collected during the Hurricane Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment (RAINEX) intensive observation period on 11 September 2005. Results showed that the spinup of the secondary tangential wind maximum during the ERC can be attributed to the efficient convergence of absolute angular momentum by the midlevel inflow of Ophelia’s dominantly stratiform rainbands. This secondary tangential wind maximum strongly contributed to the azimuthal mean tangential wind field, which is conducive for increased low-level supergradient winds and corresponding outflow. The low-level supergradient forcing enhanced convergence to form a secondary eyewall. Ophelia provides a unique example of an ERC occurring in a weaker storm with predominantly stratiform rainbands, suggesting an important role of stratiform precipitation processes in the development of secondary eyewalls.

  keypoint1: The 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season witnessed activity 25% above
    the long-term average, due mainly to high activity in the subtropics
  keypoint2: The environmental fields that explain most variance in long-term hurricane
    activity all predicted a below-normal 2018 hurricane season
  keypoint3: The 2018 hurricane season highlights the need for seasonal hurricane
    outlooks to be issued in terms of probability of exceedance
  abstract: The 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season was a destructive season with
    hurricanes Florence and Michael causing significant damage in the southeastern
    United States. In keeping with most destructive hurricane seasons, basinwide tropical
    cyclone activity was above average in 2018?by ~25% for named storm numbers, hurricane
    numbers, and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE). In contrast to this above-normal
    activity, the August?September tropical environmental fields that explain ~50%
    of the variance in Atlantic basin hurricane activity between 1950 and 2017 anticipated
    a well below-average 2018 hurricane season. The surprisingly large mismatch between
    the observed and replicated levels of hurricane activity in 2018 is an extreme
    example of the uncertainty inherent in seasonal hurricane outlooks and highlights
    the need for these outlooks to be issued in terms of probability of exceedance.
    Such probabilistic information would better clarify the uncertainty associated
    with hurricane outlooks to the benefit of users. With retrospective knowledge
    of the August?September 2018 key tropical environmental fields, the chance that
    the observed 2018 Atlantic hurricane activity would occur is about 5%. The reasons
    for the surprisingly high hurricane activity in 2018 are a hurricane outbreak
    in early September and, in particular, the occurrence of unusually high tropical
    cyclone activity in the subtropical North Atlantic. The hyperactive subtropical
    activity was not anticipated because contemporary statistical models of seasonal
    Atlantic hurricane activity lack skill in anticipating subtropical ACE compared
    to tropical ACE.
  summary: Seasonal outlooks for North Atlantic hurricane activity contribute to the
    anticipation of risk for insurance companies, other weather-sensitive businesses,
    and local and national governments. However, the uncertainty associated with such
    forecasts is often unclear. This reduces their benefit and contributes to the
    perception of forecast “busts.” The issue is highlighted by the destructive and
    surprising 25% above-average 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. Retrospective examination
    of the key August–September 2018 environmental fields that explain ~50% of long‐term
    Atlantic hurricane activity shows that all were consistent with a well below‐average
    2018 hurricane season. A below‐normal season was also anticipated by hurricane
    outlooks issued in early August 2018. The large mismatch between the observed
    and replicated levels of hurricane activity in 2018 is an extreme example of the
    uncertainty inherent in hurricane outlooks. We show that this uncertainty may
    be properly clarified by expressing outlooks in terms of probability of exceedance.
    The likelihood that the observed 2018 hurricane activity would occur with retrospective
    knowledge of the key environmental fields is about 5%. Hyperactive storm activity
    in the subtropical North Atlantic contributed to the surprisingly active 2018
    hurricane season. The unusual subtropical activity was not anticipated because
    statistical models lack skill in anticipating such activity.

  keypoint1: A 30-year climatology for 1991–2020 is considerably higher than that for 1981–2010 and is likely not representative of the full record
  keypoint2: Thirty-year North Atlantic climatologies have larger root mean squared hurricane prediction errors than 50-year climatologies
  keypoint3: The most representative climatology for 2021–2030 is likely 1971–2020 with an adjustment for short-lived named storms
  abstract: >
    Most climatologies use 30-year epochs that are updated at the start of each decade. They will shift from 1981–2010 to 1991–2020 in 2021. North Atlantic hurricane activity has large interdecadal variability that may lead to biases in a 30-year climatology. A previous inactive hurricane period included 1981–1990, while 2011–2020 is a part of the ongoing active era. As a result, the 1991–2020 normals are more active than the 1981–2010 normals, with the median accumulated cyclone energy increasing by around 40%. A 50-year epoch would be more likely to capture a full cycle of multidecadal variability, and this study demonstrates that 50-year climatologies have historically been better predictors of the subsequent decade's hurricane activity. This paper argues that the 1971–2020 climatology should, therefore, be the baseline for hurricane activity for the next decade with a possible adjustment for the non-climatic increase in observed short-lived tropical cyclones.
  summary: >
    Climatologies are typically 30-year averages that are updated at the start of a new decade (e.g., in 2021, the 30-year average will be updated from 1981–2010 to 1991–2020). However, known changes in hurricane activity between decades are not typically well represented by a 30-year climatology. For example, 1981–1990 was a part of the last quiet period, but 2011–2020 is a part of the current active era. The 1991–2020 hurricane climatology is, therefore, much more active than 1981–2010. An integrated metric accounting for intensity, duration, and frequency of storms increases by 40% from the 1981–2010 to the 1991–2020 climatology. A 50-year climatology is more likely to include both active and quiet eras, which gives a better picture of “normal” hurricane activity. This study shows that the 50-year climatology has better predictive skill for seasonal hurricane activity than that of the standard 30-year average. New technology has also led to an increase in the number of short-lived tropical storms. The 50-year average for 1971–2020 with an adjustment for short-lived storms is likely to be the most representative climatology for the next decade.

  title: Relationship between the Pacific-North American pattern and the frequency
    of tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific

  keypoint1: Boreal summer western North Pacific tropical cyclone frequency is inversely
    linked to the concurrent Pacific-North American pattern
  keypoint2: A greater number of tropical cyclones form north (south) of 12.5°N during
    low (high) Pacific-North American pattern phases
  keypoint3: The Pacific-North American pattern influences tropical cyclone genesis
    predominately by modulating large-scale dynamic conditions
  abstract: The frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific
    during June–November has a significant inverse correlation with the concurrent
    Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern from 1965 to 2016. During low PNA years,
    more TCs form north of 12.5°N, with significantly greater  TC occurrences from
    15 to 20°N, compared to high PNA years. The difference in TC genesis location
    can be explained by the differences in the genesis potential index derived from
    the environmental variables in both PNA phases. The PNA influences TC formation
    primarily by modulating large-scale dynamic conditions, with thermodynamic conditions
    playing a lesser role. In low PNA years, low-level anomalous cyclonic lows over
    the Philippines and in the subtropical central Pacific provide significant positive
    relative vorticity anomalies favorable for TC genesis. Additionally, there is
    also less vertical wind shear to the north of the Philippines due to enhanced
    winds at low levels and weaker winds at upper levels.
  summary: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are the most devastating natural disasters in many
    coastal regions, including over the western North Pacific (WNP). Therefore, the
    characteristics and driving mechanisms of WNP TC activity have been studied extensively
    over the past several decades. Previous publications indicated that El Niño-Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) played the most important role on an interannual basis in modulating
    WNP TC formation, movement, and intensity. However, the interannual frequency
    of WNP TCs is only weakly influenced by ENSO. Here we find that there exists a
    significant negative correlation between the annual number of boreal summer WNP
    TCs and the concurrent Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. Distinct from other
    climate modes (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation),
    the inverse relationship between WNP TC frequency and the PNA is relatively stable
    and independent of the period analyzed. Furthermore, the PNA influences the formation
    of WNP TCs through a modulation of the large-scale environment, particularly the
    dynamic conditions. During low PNA years, the large-scale dynamic conditions are
    more favorable for TC development, compared to high PNA years. Our results imply
    that one may be able to improve the prediction of WNP TC frequency by considering
    variations in the PNA pattern.

  abstract: Rapid intensification (RI) refers to a significant increase in tropical
    cyclone (TC) intensity over a short period of time. A TC can also undergo multiple
    RI events during its lifetime, and these RI events pose a significant challenge
    for operational forecasting. The long-term tendency in RI magnitude of TCs over
    the western North Pacific is investigated in this study. During 1979-2018, a significant
    increasing trend is found in RI magnitude, which primarily results from the significant
    increasing number of strong RI events, defined as 24-h intensity increases of
    at least 50 kt. Furthermore, there are significantly more (slightly fewer) strong
    RI occurrences west (east) of 155°E in 1999-2018 than in 1979-1998. Significant
    increases in strong RI occurrences are located over the region bounded by 10°~20°N,
    120°~150°E. These changes are likely induced by the warming ocean but appear uncorrelated
    with changes in the atmospheric environment. By contrast, there are slight decreases
    in strong RI occurrences over the region bounded by 12.5°~22.5°N, 155°~170°E,
    likely due to the offset between RI-favorable influences of the warming ocean
    and RI-unfavorable influences of increasing vertical wind shear (VWS).

  abstract: This study revisits the nonlinear relationship between tropical cyclone
    (TC) size and intensity over the western North Pacific (WNP). Using best track
    data from the Japan Meteorological Agency from 2007‐2019, we find that the statistical
    turning point on a fitted size‐intensity curve only exists for TCs with greater
    lifetime peak intensities (e.g. typhoons). The track and evolution type are two
    factors determining the statistical size‐intensity relationship. The nonlinear
    size‐intensity relationship is only observed for recurving typhoons reaching their
    peak intensities and sizes at different times, due to a non‐monotonic size change
    during the weakening stage. The slight size decrease in the initial weakening
    stage can be linked to a TC weakening‐induced shrinkage balanced by a baroclinic
    expansion when recurving typhoons move into higher latitudes. Finally, different
    evolution types for WNP typhoons can be determined by the ratio of intensity/size
    to its theoretical maximum.
  summary: Tropical cyclone (TC) size and intensity are two primary metrics determining
    the destructive potential of a TC. Previous studies have reported a nonlinear
    size‐intensity relationship, in which TC size substantially increases with intensity
    to an upper bound and then remains constant or even decreases with increasing
    intensity. Using best tracks from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) for 2007‐2019,
    we find that this statistical nonlinear size‐intensity relationship only occurs
    for TCs with stronger lifetime maximum intensities (e.g. typhoons). Whether the
    size‐intensity relationship is linear or nonlinear is jointly determined by the
    track that the TC takes and its evolution type on a size‐intensity diagram. There
    is a linear size‐intensity relationship for recurving typhoons reaching their
    peak intensities and sizes simultaneously and for typhoons that are relatively
    straight‐moving. For other recurving typhoons, the nonlinear size‐intensity relationship
    is primarily caused by a nonlinear size decrease during the weakening stage. We
    speculate that, as recurving typhoons move poleward, weakening TCs often begin
    to shrink, while the interaction between the TC and the midlatitude circulation
    leads to a baroclinic expansion of TC size. Finally, different evolution types
    for WNP typhoons can be determined by the ratio of intensity/size to its theoretical
    maximum.

  keypoint3: false
  abstract: The number of tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific (WNP) during spring (March-May) has a significant inverse correlation with concurrent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions during the period from 1979-2018. This relationship is different from the previously-documented weak relationship between TC frequency and ENSO during the climatologically most active portion of the TC season. In general, TCs seldom occur in El Niño years during March-May, whereas they frequently form over the western part of the WNP, particularly to the southeast of the Philippines, in La Niña years. This difference can be largely explained by ENSO-driven differences in the genesis potential index as derived from environmental variables. In La Niña years, the abnormally moist mid-troposphere, which relates to the strengthened vertical transport of water vapor induced by the enhanced Walker Circulation, primarily favors TC development, while increased sea surface temperatures and positive low-level relative vorticity anomalies appear to play a lesser role in impacting TC formation.

  abstract: This study examines microphysical and thermodynamic characteristics of the 20 June 2015 mesoscale convective system (MCS) observed during the Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) experiment, specifically within the transition zone (TZ), enhanced stratiform rain region (ESR), anvil region, melting layer (ML), and the rear inflow jet (RIJ). Analyses are developed from airborne optical array probe data and multiple-Doppler wind and reflectivity syntheses using data from the airborne NOAA Tail Doppler Radar (TDR) and ground-based Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) radars. Seven spiral ascents/descents of the NOAA P-3 aircraft were executed within various regions of the 20 June MCS. Aggregation modified by sublimation was observed in each MCS region, regardless of whether the sampling was within the RIJ. Sustained sublimation and evaporation of precipitation in subsaturated layers led to a trend of downward moistening across the ESR spirals, with greater degrees of subsaturation maintained when in the vicinity of the descending RIJ. In all cases where melting was observed, the ML acted as a prominent thermodynamic boundary, with differing rates of change in temperature and relative humidity above and below the ML. Two spiral profiles coincident with the rear inflow notch provided unique ob- servations within the TZ and were interpreted in the context of similar observations from the 29 June 2003 Bow Echo and Mesoscale Convective Vortex Experiment MCS. There, sublimation cooling and enhanced descent within the RIJ allowed ice particles to survive to temperatures as warm as 16.88C before completely sublimating/evaporating.

  abstract: In this study w e explored why the different initial tropical cyclone structures can result in different steady‐state maximum intensities in model simulations with the same environmental conditions. We discovered a linear relationsh ip between the radius of maximum wind (rm) and the absolute angular momentum that passes through rm (Mm) in the model simulated steady‐state tropical cyclones that rm = aMm+b. This nonnegligible intercept b is found to be the key to making a steady‐state storm with a larger Mm more intense. The sensitivity experiments show that this nonzero b results mainly from horizontal turbulent mixing and decreases with decreased horizontal mixing. Using this linear relationship from the simulations, it is also found that the degree of supergradient wind is a function of Mm as well as the turbulent mixing length such that both a larger Mm and/or a reduced turbulent mixing length result in larger supergradient winds.
  summary: According to the maximum potential intensity theory, the maximum intensities for tropical cyclones should be the same given the same environmental conditions, which means the radius of maximum wind (rm) at the boundary layer top should be linearly proportional to the absolute angular momentum such that rm~aMm. In model simulations, however, different initial vortex structures usually result in different quasi‐steady‐state maximum intensities. In this paper, an axisymmetric numerical model is used to evaluate the TC's maximum intensities at the quasi‐steady state and explore the cause of this discrepancy between the model simulations and the maximum potential intensity theory. The model results exhibit that the various values of rm do have a linear relation with Mm, which is predicted by the maximum potential intensity theory. However, there is a non‐negligible intercept term, b, in this linear relation (rm = aMm+b), which is found to be the key to making a steady‐state storm with a larger Mm more intense.

  abstract: The criteria and assumptions that were used to derive the steady-state tropical cyclone intensity and structure theory of Emanuel and Rotunno are assessed using three-dimensional convection-allowing simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. One real-data case of Hurricane Patricia (2015) and two idealized simulations with and without vertical wind shear are examined. In all three simulations, the gradient wind balance is valid in the inner-core region above the boundary layer. The angular momentum M and saturation entropy surfaces s* near the top of the boundary layer, in the outflow region and along the angular momentum surface that passes the low-level radius of maximum wind MRMW are nearly congruent, satisfying the criterion of slantwise moist neutrality in the vicinity of MRMW. The theoretically derived maximum wind magnitude above the boundary layer compares well with the simulated maximum tangential wind and gradient wind using the azimuthally averaged pressure field during the intensification and quasi-steady state of the simulated storms. The Richardson number analysis of the simulated storms shows that small Richardson number (0 , Ri #1) exists in the outflow region, related to both large local shear and small static stability. This criticality of the Richardson number indicates the existence of small-scale turbulence in the outflow region. We also show that the stratifi- cation of temperature along the M surfaces at the outflow region for steady-state hurricanes is approximately applicable in these three-dimensional simulations, while the radial distribution of gradient wind is qualitatively comparable to the theoretical radial profiles. Some caveats regarding the theory are also discussed.

  abstract: This study revisits the axisymmetric tropical cyclone (TC) theory from D. K. Lilly’s unpublished manuscript (Lilly model) and compares it to axisymmetric TC simulations from a nonhydrostatic cloud model. Analytic solutions of the Lilly model are presented through simplifying assumptions. Sensitivity experiments varying the sea surface, boundary layer and tropopause temperatures, and the absolute angular momentum (M) at some outer radius in the Lilly model show that these variations influence the radial structure of the tangential wind profile V(r) at the boundary layer top. However, these parameter variations have little effect on the inner-core normalized tangential wind, V(r/rm)/Vm, where Vm is the maximum tangential wind at radius rm. The outflow temperature T‘ as a function of M (or saturation entropy s*) is found to be the only input that changes the normalized tangential wind radial structure in the Lilly model. In contrast with the original as- sumption of the Lilly model that T‘(s*) is determined by the environment, it is argued here that T‘(s*) is determined by the TC interior flow under the environmental constraint of the tropopause height. The present study shows that the inner-core tangential wind radial structure from the Lilly model generally agrees well with nonhydrostatic cloud model simulations except in the eyewall region where the Lilly model tends to underestimate the tangential winds due to its balanced-dynamics assumptions. The wind structure in temperature–radius coordinates from the Lilly model can largely reproduce the nu- merical simulation results. Though the Lilly model is based on a number of simplifying assumptions, this paper shows its utility in understanding steady-state TC intensity and structure.

  keypoint3: Both radial and vertical structures should be considered in the evaluation metrics of modeled tropical cyclones
  abstract: "Hurricane Patricia (2015) over the eastern Pacific was a record-breaking tropical cyclone (TC) under a very favorable environment during its rapid intensification (RI) period, which makes it an optimal real case for studying RI dynamics and predictability. In this study, we performed ensemble Kalman filter analyses at Patricia's early development stage using both traditional observations and the Office of Naval Research Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI) field campaign data. It is shown that assimilating the inner-core TCI observations produces a stronger initial vortex and significantly improves the prediction of RI. Analysis of observation sensitivity experiments shows that the deep-layer dropsonde observations have high impact on both the primary and secondary circulations for the entire troposphere while the radar observations have the most impact on the primary circulations near aircraft flight level. A wide range of intensification scenarios are obtained through two sets of ensemble forecasts initialized with and without assimilating the TCI data prior to the RI onset. Verification of the ensemble forecasts against the TCI observations during the RI period shows that forecast errors toward later stages can originate from two different error sources at early stages of the vortex structure: One is a timing error from a delayed vortex development such that the TC evolution is the same but shifted in time; the other is due to a totally different storm such that there is no moment in time the simulated storm can obtain a correct TC structure."

  keypoint2: Shortwave radiation can modify secondary eyewall formations by reducing the extent and magnitude of diabatic heating in convective rainbands
  keypoint3:  The interactions between shortwave radiation and cloud microphysics are critical for simulating eyewall replacement cycles
  abstract: The sensitivity of tropical cyclone secondary eyewall formation (SEF) and subsequent eyewall replacement cycles (ERCs) to shortwave radiation is examined in this study by varying the solar constant and diurnal cycle at different times prior to an ERC using idealized simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The magnitude of shortwave radiation plays an important role in modifying the timing of the SEF with nonlinear interactions amplifying the SEF formation differences at longer lead-times. Shortwave radiation has a delaying effect on the SEF and ERC primarily through its modifications of the distribution of convective and stratiform heating profiles in the rainbands. Shortwave radiation reduces both the area and diabatic heating of convection in the model domain, while increasing the amount of stratiform precipitation that has weaker low-level cooling and upper-level heating rates. The primary mechanism by which shortwave radiation reduces the diabatic heating profile and frequency of convection in the rainbands is through heating of the mid-upper troposphere which stabilizes the region and reduces convective available potential energy.

  abstract: A growing body of work has documented the existence of diurnal oscillations in the tropical cyclone outflow layer. These diurnal pulses have been examined primarily using satellites or numerical models, and detailed full tropospheric observations or case study analyses of diurnal pulses are lacking. Questions remain on the vertical extent of diurnal pulses and whether diurnal pulses are coupled to convective bands or constrained to the outflow layer. During the Propagation of Intraseasonal Tropical Oscillations (PISTON) field campaign, diurnal oscillations in the upper-level clouds were observed during Typhoon Kong-rey’s (2018) rapid intensification. Over a 3.5-day period where a broad distribution of cold upper-level clouds was overhead, detailed observations of Typhoon Kong-rey’s rainbands show that convection had reduced echo tops but enhanced reflectivity and differential reflectivity aloft compared to other observations during PISTON. Shortwave heating in the upper levels increased the stability profile in an overall favorable thermodynamic environment for convection during the day, which could help to explain the diurnal differences in convective structure. Under the cirrus canopy, nocturnal convection was deeper and daytime convection shallower in contrast to the rest of the PISTON dataset. Diurnal oscillations in the brightness temperatures were found to be coupled to radially outward propagating convective rainbands that were preceded ~6 h by outflow jets. The cooling pulses occurred earlier than found in previous studies. The pulses were asymmetric spatially, which is likely due to a combination of the vertical wind shear and storm intensity.

  abstract: The characteristics of official National Hurricane Center (NHC) intensity forecast errors are examined for the North Atlantic and east Pacific basins from 1989 to 2018. It is shown how rapid intensification (RI) and rapid weakening (RW) influence yearly NHC forecast errors for forecasts between 12 and 48 h in length. In addition to being the tail of the intensity change distribution, RI and RW are at the tails of the forecast error distribution. Yearly mean absolute forecast errors are positively correlated with the yearly number of RI/RW occurrences and explain roughly 20% of the variance in the Atlantic and 30% in the east Pacific. The higher occurrence of RI events in the east Pacific contributes to larger intensity forecast errors overall but also a better probability of detection and success ratio. Statistically significant improvements to 24-h RI forecast biases have been made in the east Pacific and to 24-h RW biases in the Atlantic. Over-ocean 24-h RW events cause larger mean errors in the east Pacific that have not improved with time. Environmental predictors from the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) are used to diagnose what conditions lead to the largest RI and RW forecast errors on average. The forecast error distributions widen for both RI and RW when tropical systems expe- rience low vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperature, and moderate low-level relative humidity. Consistent with existing literature, the forecast error distributions suggest that improvements to our observational capabilities, understanding, and prediction of inner-core processes is paramount to both RI and RW prediction.

  abstract: Potential intensity theory predicts that the upper-tropospheric temperature acts as an important constraint on tropical cyclone (TC) intensity. The physical mechanisms through which the upper troposphere impacts TC intensity and structure have not been fully explored, however, due in part to limited observations and the complex interactions between clouds, radiation, and TC dynamics. In this study, idealized Weather Research and Forecasting Model ensembles initialized with a combination of three different tropopause temperatures and with no radiation, longwave radiation only, and full diurnal radiation are used to examine the physical mechanisms in the TC–upper-tropospheric temperature relationship on weather time scales. Simulated TC intensity and structure are strongly sensitive to colder tropopause temperatures using only longwave radia- tion, but are less sensitive using full radiation and no radiation. Colder tropopause temperatures result in deeper convection and increased ice mass aloft in all cases, but are more intense only when radiation was included. Deeper convection leads to increased local longwave cooling rates but reduced top-of-the- atmosphere outgoing longwave radiation, such that the total radiative heat sink is reduced from a Carnot engine perspective in stronger storms. We hypothesize that a balanced response in the secondary circulation described by the Eliassen equation arises from upper-troposphere radiative cooling anomalies that lead to stronger tangential winds. The results of this study further suggest that radiation and cloud–radiative feed- backs have important impacts on weather time scales.

  keypoint1: This manuscript proposes using the QBO to model cyclone tracks over the
    North Indian Ocean
  keypoint2: More North Indian Ocean TCs were found to form when the QBO was in its
    east phase than when the QBO was in its west phase, and these TCs were more likely
    to track westward and northwestward.
  keypoint3: Alternatively, when the QBO was in its west phase, TCs were more likely
    to track northward and northeastward.
  abstract: Previous studies have shown that the skill of seasonal forecasts of tropical
    cyclone (TC) activity over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) tends to be poor. This
    paper investigates the forecast potential of TC formation, trajectories and points
    of landfall in the NIO region using an index of the stratospheric quasi-biennial
    oscillation (QBO) as the predictor variable in a new statistical seasonal forecast
    model. Genesis was modelled by kernel density estimation, tracks were fitted using
    a generalized additive model (GAM) approach with an Euler integration step, and
    landfall location was estimated using a country mask. The model was trained on
    30 years of TC observations (1980–2009) from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center
    and the QBO index at lags from 0 to 6 months. Over this time period, and within
    each season and QBO phase, the kernel density estimator modelled the distribution
    of genesis points, and the cyclone trajectories were then fit by the GAM along
    the observed cyclone tracks as smooth functions of location. Trajectories were
    simulated from randomly selected genesis points in the kernel density estimates.
    Ensembles of cyclone paths were traced, taking account of random innovations every
    6-hr along the GAM-fitted velocity fields, to determine the points of landfall.
    Lead–lag analysis was used to assess the best predictor timescales for TC forecast
    potential. We found that the best model utilized the QBO index with a 3-month
    lead. Two hindcast validation methods were applied. First, leave-one-out cross-validation
    was performed where the country of landfall was decided by the majority vote of
    the simulated tracks. Second, the distances between the landfall locations in
    the observations and simulations were calculated. Application of seasonal forecast
    analysis further indicated that including information on the state of the QBO
    has the potential to improve the skill of TC seasonal forecasts in the NIO region.

  keypoint1: The eastern North Pacific set records for hurricane activity in 2018
    with relatively little influence from El Niño-Southern Oscillation
  keypoint2: Combined above (below)-average sea surface temperatures and moisture
    (shear) during August and September contributed to the record season
  keypoint3: The strongly positive Pacific Meridional Mode also supported the increase
    in eastern North Pacific hurricane activity
  abstract: The extremely active 2018 eastern North Pacific (ENP) hurricane season
    set records for number of hurricane days, major hurricane days, and accumulated
    cyclone energy (ACE). The Western Development Region (116°W–180°) was especially
    active, shattering its prior record for ACE set in 2015. In addition, Hawaii was
    impacted by Hurricane Lane in August and Tropical Storm Olivia in September. Despite
    above-normal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and below-normal vertical wind shear
    in 2018, large-scale conditions were generally less conducive for tropical cyclone
    (TC) formation than in 2015. However, the strong subtropical ridge in August and
    September of 2018 enhanced westward steering flow, thereby keeping TCs over hurricane-favorable
    conditions and preventing recurvature toward lower SSTs and higher vertical wind
    shear. The 2018 ENP hurricane season highlights that El Niño conditions are not
    necessary for extremely high ENP TC activity.
  summary: The 2018 eastern North Pacific hurricane season broke records, particularly
    when considering an index that accounts for frequency, intensity, and duration
    of hurricanes. The previous record was set in 2015 during a strong El Niño event
    that increased ocean warmth and thus provided more fuel for hurricanes. Even though
    a weak El Niño did not develop until late in the 2018 hurricane season, the ocean
    was warmer than normal in the region where the hurricanes formed, which helped
    support their development. After the hurricanes formed, the flow of the atmosphere
    generally kept them over warmer water, helping them last longer. We need to study
    more seasons like 2018 to better understand when eastern North Pacific hurricane
    seasons will be active without the presence of a strong El Niño.

  title: Factors affecting the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season and the role of the Indian Ocean Dipole

  keypoint1: Most 2019 Atlantic tropical cyclone activity occurred during a six-week period of conducive environmental conditions.
  keypoint2: The subtropical Atlantic was more favorable than normal for tropical cyclones.
  keypoint3: The strongly positive Indian Ocean Dipole likely contributed to below-normal Atlantic tropical cyclone activity in October.
  abstract: The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season exhibited above-average Accumulated Cyclone Energy<97>60% of which was produced by Hurricanes Dorian and Lorenzo. Most tropical cyclone (TC) activity was concentrated in a ~6-week period from late August to early October. During the early part of the season, relatively TC-unfavorable conditions persisted in the maindevelopment region (MDR). The MDR environment became largely favorable in September followed by an abrupt shift back to less conducive conditions in October coincident with a strongly positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The IOD produced an El Niño-like teleconnection pattern observed through 200-hPa velocity potential anomalies. In the subtropical Atlantic, above-average sea surface temperatures persisted for much of the season, which may have contributed to increased activity at higher latitudes. Given the neutral El Niño-Southern Oscillation conditions during the 2019 hurricane season, our study highlights the need for further analysis of IOD impacts on Atlantic TC activity.
  summary: In 2019, the Atlantic produced above-average activity according to Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE), an index that captures storm intensity and longevity. The two strongest hurricanes, Dorian and Lorenzo, contributed 60% of the season<92>s total ACE. Most storms occurred in an active 6-week period from late August to early October when the environment became more favorable for hurricanes. But after that, conditions became less favorable when the western Indian Ocean became much warmer than normal and the eastern Indian Ocean became much colder than normal, an oceanic phenomenon referred to as a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. This strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole event produced sinking air across much of the tropics, including the Atlantic, a pattern that is El Niño-like. Since knowledge of El Niño helps us predict Atlantic seasonal hurricane activity, it is possible that understanding more about the Indian Ocean Dipole<92>s impacts on Atlantic hurricane activity will help us improve seasonal hurricane forecasts.

  abstract: The Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign In the Pacific (PRECIP) aims to improve our understanding of extreme rainfall processes in the East Asian summer monsoon. A convection- permitting ensemble-based data assimilation and forecast system (the PSU WRF-EnKF system) was run in real-time in the summers of 2020 to 2021 in advance of the 2022 field campaign, assimilating all-sky infrared (IR) radiances from the geostationary Himawari-8 and GOES-16 satellites, and providing 48-hour ensemble forecasts every day for weather briefings and discussions. This is the first time that all-sky IR data assimilation has been performed in a real- time forecast system at a convection-permitting resolution for several seasons. Compared with retrospective forecasts that exclude all-sky IR radiances, rainfall predictions are statistically significantly improved out to at least 4–6 hours for the real-time forecasts, which is comparable to the timescale of improvements gained from assimilating observations from the dense ground-based Doppler weather radar network. The assimilation of all-sky IR radiances also reduced the forecast errors of large-scale environments and helped to maintain a more reasonable ensemble spread compared with the counterpart experiments that didn’t assimilate all-sky IR radiances. The results indicate strong potential for improving routine short-term quantitative precipitation forecasts using these high-spatiotemporal-resolution satellite observations in the future.
  summary: During the summers of 2020–2021, the PSU WRF-EnKF data assimilation and forecast system was run in real-time in advance of the 2022 Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign In the Pacific (PRECIP), assimilating all-sky (clear-sky and cloudy) infrared radiances from the geostationary satellites into a numerical weather prediction model and providing ensemble forecasts. This study presents the first-of-its-kind systematic evaluation of the impacts of assimilating all-sky infrared radiances on short-term qualitative precipitation forecasts using multi- year, multi-region, real-time ensemble forecasts. Results suggest that rainfall forecasts are improved out to at least 4–6 hours with the assimilation of all-sky infrared radiances, comparable to the influence of assimilating radar observations, with benefits in forecasting large-scale environments and representing atmospheric uncertainties as well.

  title: Recent decrease in genesis productivity of tropical cloud clusters over the
    Western North Pacific

  keypoint1: Since the late 1990s, tropical cloud clusters have increased over the
    western North Pacific, especially over the eastern portion of the western North
    Pacific, but the frequency of TCs had decreased.
  keypoint2: There has been a decrease in genesis productivity, which was shown to
    be primarily due to increases in vertical wind shear in the eastern part of the
    western North Pacific.
  keypoint3: Since the late 1990s, the monsoon circulation in the western North Pacific
    has also weakened, shifting the upper-tropospheric trough farther west and increasing
    shear in the eastern part of the western North Pacific.
  abstract: Tropical cloud clusters (TCCs) play a critical role in sustaining tropical
    large-scale systems and are traditionally viewed as precursors for tropical cyclone
    (TC) genesis. This study focuses on the decadal changes in genesis productivity
    (GP), e.g. the efficiency of TCCs developing into TCs, and shows a significant
    decrease in GP over the western North Pacific (WNP) basin since 1998, when a climate
    regime change occurred. The significant decrease in TC frequency and the significant
    increase in TCCs, especially over the eastern region of the WNP basin, have combined
    to result in a reduced GP since 1998. These changes are dependent on the combined
    changes in large-scale atmospheric-oceanic conditions over the WNP basin. A decadal
    change in vertical wind shear, especially over the eastern portion of the WNP
    basin, appears to be the most important contributor to the recent decrease in
    GP. Increased vertical wind shear suppresses TC genesis but enhances the frequency
    of TCCs. Secondary positive contributions to the recent decrease in GP are from
    local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and low-level relative vorticity. These
    positive contributions to the recent decrease in GP are partly cancelled out by
    a negative contribution from enhanced mid-relative moisture. Changes in these
    large-scale conditions associated with the recent decrease in GP over the WNP
    basin since 1998 are closely related to the weakening monsoon circulation and
    the westward shift of the tropical upper-tropospheric trough over the WNP. This
    is likely related to the changes observed in tropical SST anomalies around the
    globe.

  abstract: The tropical cyclone (TC)-centric approach developed in previous studies
    tends to overemphasize the direct impact of tropical waves and underestimates
    their large-scale modulation of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclogenesis
    (TCG). To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new approach based
    on empirical orthogonal function analyses to re-examine associations of multiple
    waves, including the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), quasi-biweekly oscillation
    (QBWO), convective equatorial Rossby (ER) waves, and synoptic scale waves (SSWs),
    with WNP TCG events. There is a close association between WNP TCG events (total
    of 273 TCs in this study) and SSWs (~ 64%), MJO (~ 68%), QBWO (~ 64%) and ER (~ 65%)
    waves. These suggest that SSW is critical for many TCG events, and all of these
    intra-seasonal waves significantly modulate TCG events. A majority of TCs (~ 79%)
    were found to be related to more than one wave type, indicating an important role
    for a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic conditions associated with multiple
    waves in TCG events. Further analyses show that SSW activity is strongly modulated
    by the MJO and ER waves, while the QBWO has no significant impact on SSWs. During
    convectively active MJO and ER phases, stronger SSW trains with more distinct
    southeast-northwestward aligned structures can be found compared to convectively
    inactive phases. Similar intra-seasonal modulation of the transition from the
    mixed Rossby-gravity waves from the equatorial central Pacific to the SSW trains
    over the WNP by the three waves is noted, with such transitions largely favored
    during convectively active MJO and ER phases.

  title: Recent increased co-variability of tropical cyclogenesis latitude-longitude
    over the western North Pacific during the extended boreal summer

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0009.1
  keypoint1: Increasing covariability of western North Pacific tropical cylogenesis
    latitude-longitude has been observed since 1998
  keypoint2: Strengthening of the relationship may be due to changing ENSO conditions,
    with Central Pacific El Nino events more common since 1998
  keypoint3: Changes in tropical Indian Ocean SST may also play a role in the observed
    changing cyclogenesis latitude-longitude relationship
  abstract: This study examines interdecadal changes in the interannual relationship
    between the extended boreal summer (May–November) tropical cyclogenesis (TCG)
    latitude and longitude over the western North Pacific Ocean (WNP) during 1979–2016.
    Increasing covariability of WNP TCG latitude and longitude is observed since 1998,
    which is found to be closely linked to shifting ENSO conditions and a tropical
    Pacific climate regime shift. Accompanied by an increasing occurrence in central
    Pacific (CP) ENSO events during recent decades, there has been a more consistent
    northwestward or southeastward shift of WNP TCG location since 1998. These coherent
    latitude and longitude shifts were generally not evident during 1979–97, a period
    characterized by a more conventional eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO pattern. Our statistical
    results show a robust relationship between TCG latitude and the Hadley circulation
    and between longitude and the Walker circulation during the period prior to and
    since the regime shift, and a possible physical explanation for the recent increased
    covariability of TCG latitude and longitude is given. During 1998–2016, there
    is a significant association of CP ENSO events with the intensity of both the
    Hadley and Walker circulations that likely caused the recent increase in the covariability
    of TCG latitude and longitude. However, the strong association of EP ENSO events
    with the intensity of the Hadley circulation but not with the Walker circulation
    during 1979–97 weakened the covariability of TCG latitude and longitude. In addition,
    changes in tropical Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures appear to also importantly
    contribute to the recent increased covariability of WNP TCG location.

  keypoint1: Interannual relationship between the western North Pacific monsoon and
    western North Pacific tropical cyclone frequency has increased since 1998
  keypoint2: false
  keypoint3: false
  abstract: This study examines the association between the western North Pacific
    (WNP) summer monsoon (WNPSM) and WNP tropical cyclone (TC) frequency during June–August
    from 1979 to 2016. The interannual relationship between the WNPSM and the total
    number of WNP TCs has strengthened since 1998. There has also been a significant
    reduction in the number of TCs forming within the WNP monsoon trough (WNPMT)—hereafter
    called ITCs, for internal or inside TCs—since 1998. These two important features
    are found to be closely associated with the climate regime shift that occurred
    around 1998. During 1998–2016, the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) tended to
    be in a cold phase, with an increasing occurrence of central Pacific–type El Niño–Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) events, whereas the 1979–97 period tended to be characterized
    by a warm phase of the PDO and east Pacific–type ENSO events. During 1998–2016,
    the tropical Pacific was characterized by enhanced easterlies, which led to a
    westward-retreated WNPMT that caused a significant decrease in ITCs over the WNP
    basin. However, there was little change in TCs outside of the WNPMT region (hereafter
    called OTCs) compared to that before 1998. A significant in-phase (out-of-phase)
    relationship between the WNPSM and the number of ITCs (OTCs) is observed before
    1998, thus greatly weakening the WNPSM–TC relationship. The recent enhanced relationship
    between the WNPSM and TCs is mainly due to a strong in-phase relationship between
    the WNPSM and ITCs. The interannual change in ITCZ is mainly controlled by WNPSM
    changes since 1998, while OTC changes are mainly modulated by changes in the tropical
    upper-tropospheric trough.

  title: Consistent late onset of the western North Pacific tropical cyclone season
    following major El Nino events

  keypoint1: Relationship between ENSO and Western North Pacific tropical cyclone
    season onset changed in the late 1990s
  keypoint2: Strong El Nino events have been associated with late starting Western
    North Pacific tropical cyclone seasons throughout the satellite era
  keypoint3: false
  abstract: Most studies have focused on variations of tropical cyclone (TC) frequency,
    intensity, and track over the western North Pacific (WNP), but variability of
    WNP TC season onset date (TCSO) has been less studied. Recent research has indicated
    a close association between WNP TCSO and sea surface temperature (SST) over the
    tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical central-eastern Pacific. This study has
    found that relationship between TCSO and SST underwent an inter-decadal change
    in the late 1990s, likely due to a climate shift that occurred around that time.
    An observed significant correlation between TCSO and SST before the late 1990s
    has been insignificant since that time. This was confirmed by the fact that El
    Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at 0.46 positively correlates with TCSO from
    1965 – 1999 (significant at the 95 % level), and the correlation becomes insignificant
    (0.16) during 1998 – 2016. Further analysis suggests that the close association
    between TCSO and SST is robust only for major El Niño events, with consistently
    extreme late TCSO following major El Niños during the satellite era. Accompanying
    the decay of major El Niños, tropical equatorial easterly anomalies in the WNP
    are driven by a Matsuno–Gill-type response to the specific SST anomaly pattern
    over the tropical Indo–Pacific sector. This in turn induces an anomalous anticyclone,
    anomalous westerly vertical wind shear, reduced mid-level moisture and suppressed
    convection over the WNP basin—all of which are unfavorable for WNP TCs, resulting
    in delayed TCSO following major El Niño events. These inter-decadal changes in
    the inter-annual correlation between TCSO and ENSO are largely due to the changing
    influence of moderate El Niño events on TCSO before and after the late 1990s.
    This study improves understanding of the ENSO–TC relationship, which should aid
    seasonal outlooks of WNP TC activity.

  abstract: Airborne Doppler radar provides detailed and targeted observations of winds and precipitation in weather systems over remote or difficult-to-access regions that can help to improve scientific understanding and weather forecasts. Quality control (QC) is necessary to remove nonweather echoes from raw radar data for subsequent analysis. The complex decision-making ability of the machine learning random-forest technique is employed to create a generalized QC method for airborne radar data in convective weather systems. A manually QCed dataset was used to train the model containing data from the Electra Doppler Radar (ELDORA) in mature and developing tropical cyclones, a tornadic supercell, and a bow echo. Successful classification of ~96% and ~93% of weather and nonweather radar gates, respectively, in withheld testing data indicate the generalizability of the method. Dual-Doppler analysis from the genesis phase of Hurricane Ophelia (2005) using data not previously seen by the model produced a comparable wind field to that from manual QC. The framework demonstrates a proof of concept that can be applied to newer airborne Doppler radars.

  abstract: The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) significantly impacts North Atlantic hurricanes, with increased hurricane activity occurring when the MJO enhances convection over Africa and the tropical Indian Ocean and suppressed hurricane activity occurring when the MJO enhances convection over the tropical Pacific. Using data from 1905 to 2015, we find more tropical cyclones (TCs) make landfall in the continental United States when the MJO enhances tropical Indian Ocean convection. In addition, when the MJO enhances Western Pacific and Western Hemisphere convection, TC activity is preferentially favored in the Caribbean, leading to more Gulf Coast landfalls. As MJO-enhanced convection moves to the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent, more storms form in the tropical Atlantic, favoring Florida Peninsula and East Coast landfalls. The MJO's TC steering wind modulation appears to be secondary to its genesis location modulation.

  keypoint1: Vertical extent of the tropical cyclone wind field correlates strongly with current intensity in observed storms. 
  keypoint2: Deep vertical vortex structure is always present in observed cases meeting a pressure-based rapid intensification definition.
  keypoint3: Vortex height decreases with increasing vertical wind shear, but taller storms intensify more in moderate shear.
  abstract: As a tropical cyclone (TC) intensifies, the tangential wind field expands vertically and increases in magnitude. Observations and modeling support vortex height as an important TC structural characteristic. The TC-RADAR dataset provides kinematic analyses for calculation of the height of the vortex (HOV) in observed storms. Analyses are azimuthally averaged with tangential wind values taken along the radius of maximum winds. A threshold-based technique is used to determine the HOV. A fixed threshold HOV strongly correlates with current intensity. A dynamic HOV metric quantifies vertical decay of tangential wind with reduced dependency on intensity. Statistically significant differences are present between dynamic HOV values in groups of steady-state, intensifying, and rapidly-intensifying cases categorized by subsequent changes in pressure. A tall vortex is always observed in cases meeting a pressure-based rapid intensification definition. Taller vortices are also evident with slower intensification. Results suggest HOV may be an important predictor for TC intensification.
  summary: As a tropical cyclone gets stronger, the wind field of the storm grows taller in the atmosphere. The height-intensity relationship is known to be present from the beginning of a tropical cyclone until its peak strength. A large dataset of airborne radar observations in tropical cyclones is used to show the strength of the relationship between vortex height and current intensity. A tall vortex is always present in observed cases prior to rapid intensification during which the minimum surface pressure at the storm center drops at a high rate. Drops in minimum surface pressure are associated with increases in wind and size in tropical cyclones. A taller vortex also favors intensification at slower rates. Improved understanding of the role that tropical cyclone height plays during intensification may be helpful for forecasting the intensity of these storms.

  abstract: To study tropical cyclones and generate forecast applications using satellite observations, researchers often consolidate disparate sources of raw and ancillary data. Data consolidation involves obtaining, co-locating and inter-calibrating data from different sensors and derived prod- ucts; calculating environmental diagnostics from a homogeneous source; and standardizing these various products for a straightforward analysis. To alleviate pre-processing issues and provide a long-term, global digital dataset of tropical cyclone satellite observations, we construct the Tropical Cyclone Precipitation, Infrared, Microwave, and Environmental Dataset (TC PRIMED). TC PRIMED contains tropical-cyclone-centric 1) inter-calibrated, multi-channel, multi-sensor mi- crowave brightness temperatures, 2) retrieved rainfall from NASA’s Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF), 3) nearly coincident geostationary satellite infrared brightness temperatures and derived metrics, 4) tropical cyclone position and intensity information, 5) ECMWF fifth-generation reanal- ysis fields and derived environmental diagnostics, and 6) precipitation radar observations from the TRMM and GPM Core Observatory satellites. TC PRIMED consists of over 176,000 overpasses of 2,101 storms from 1998 to 2019, providing researchers with an analysis-ready dataset to promote and support research into improving our understanding of the relationship between tropical cyclone convective and precipitation structure, intensity, and environment. Here, we briefly describe data sources and processing steps to create TC PRIMED. To demonstrate TC PRIMED’s potential utility for studying important tropical cyclone processes and for application development, we present a shear-relative composite analysis of several multi-sensor satellite variables relative to the tropical cyclone lifetime maximum intensity. The composite analysis provides a simple example of how TC PRIMED can benefit future studies to advance our understanding of tropical cyclones and improve forecasts.

  abstract: The combination of moderate vertical wind shear (VWS) and dry environments can produce the most uncertain scenarios for tropical cyclone (TC) genesis and intensification. We investigated the sources of increased uncertainty of TC development under moderate VWS and dry environments using a set of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) ensemble simulations. Statistical analysis of ensemble members for precursor events and time-lagged correlations indicates that successful TC development is dependent on a specific set of precursor events. A deficiency in any of these precursor events leads to a fail- ure of TC intensification. The uncertainty of TC intensification can be largely attributed to the probabilistic characteristics of precursor events lining up together before TC intensification. The critical bifurcation point between successful and failed trials in these idealized simulations is the sustained vortex alignment process. Even for the failed intensification cases, most simulations showed deep organized convection, which reformed a midlevel vortex. However, for the failed cycles, the new midlevel vortex could not sustain vertical alignment with the low-level center and was carried away by VWS shortly. Under the most uncertain setup (VWS = 7.5 m/s and 50% moisture), the latest-developing ensemble member had seven events of tilt decreasing and increasing again that occurred during the 8 days before genesis. Some unsuccessful precursor events looked very close to the successful ones, implying limits on the intrinsic predictability for TC genesis and intensification in moderately sheared and dry environments.

  keypoint3: Forecast errors of the Bermuda High dominated the steering flow errors for the 2017 hurricane season
  abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) track forecasting provides essential guidance for coastal communities. However, track forecast errors still occur, highlighting the need for continued research into error sources. Piecewise potential vorticity (PV) inversion is used systematically to quantitatively diagnose errors in track forecasts in four models during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. The deep layer mean steering flow (DLMSF) provides a sufficient proxy for hurricane movement, and DLMSF errors are correlated with TC track errors. Analysis of track forecasts for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria reveals that their track errors are attributed to steering errors caused by misrepresentations of specific pressure systems. Harvey's westward track error in the GFS resulted from zonal wind errors from the Continental High, while Irma's northward track error in the SHiELD gfsIC resulted from meridional wind errors in the Bermuda High and Continental High. Maria's southward track error in the IFS resulted from meridional wind errors in the Bermuda High and a misrepresentation of Jose to Maria's northwest. The mean absolute error of the DLMSF shows that the Bermuda High contributed the most to steering flow errors in the cases examined. Our results show that piecewise PV inversion can identify the sources of biases in TC track forecasts. The correction of these biases may lead to improved track forecasts. Quantitative diagnostics presented here provide useful information for future model development. 
  summary: A tropical cyclone typically moves with the environmental wind, which is generated by several large‐scale pressure systems (e.g., Bermuda High, Continental High) in the atmosphere. Weather models can predict the path of tropical cyclones, but these forecasts have errors. Tropical cyclones often bring devastation along their path, so it is important to mitigate track errors to provide better warnings for impacted communities. Here, we use a diagnostic technique called “piecewise potential vorticity inversion” to understand how the environmental wind causes errors in tropical cyclone tracks. In three different examples of hurricane track forecasts, we show that errors in the predicted track are caused by errors in the environmental wind from specific pressure systems. By considering numerous cases, we can also identify model biases, or errors that are consistent throughout many forecasts. These errors are a result of errors in the models themselves. Overall, our results show that piecewise potential vorticity inversion is a useful diagnostic tool that has the potential to improve track forecasts through the identification of model biases.

  abstract: Abstract Tropical cyclone (TC) low-level tangential wind structure is known to be an important input for risk assessment (e.g., storm surge). However, a realistic TC wind structure model with easy implementation is still needed for many applications. In this study, we obtain an inner-core wind structure model purely from an empirical approach, which significantly reduces the complexity of TC wind profiles. From idealized simulations with different initial vortex structures, it is found that the absolute angular momentum (M) outside the radius of maximum wind (rm) is quasi-linear. This quasi-linear M slope in a normalized coordinate decreases with TC intensity. The consequent linear M slope wind model can largely capture the simulated TC inner-core wind structure and has the potential for many practical applications.

  abstract: This contribution summarizes the significant progress in a variety of topic areas related to internal tropical cyclone (TC) intensity change processes over 2018–2022 from the WMO Tenth International Workshop on Tropical Cyclones (IWTC-10). These topic areas include surface and boundary layer processes; TC internal structure and microphysical processes; and, radiation interactions with TCs. Recent studies better frame the uncertainty in the surface drag and enthalpy coefficients at high wind speeds. These parameters greatly impact TC intensity and it is therefore important that more direct measurements of these boundary layer parameters are made. Particularly significant scientific strides have been made in TC boundary layers. These advancements have been achieved through improved coupled models, large-eddy simulations, theoretical advance- ments, and detailed observations. It is now clear that the research field needs to better represent the eddy viscosity throughout the depth of the boundary layer. Furthermore, detailed study of coherent structures in TC boundary layers will likely be a propitious direction for the research community. Meanwhile, in-depth observational field campaigns and assiduous data analysis have made significant headway into verifying theory and modeling studies of intensification processes related to TC vortex alignment, efficient latent heating distributions, and overall 3D structure. Substantial efforts have also been made to better understand the intricate roles radiative processes play in TC evolution and intensity change. Finally, some promising progress has been made in the development of time-dependent theories of TC intensification and the predictability of internal TC intensity change. Overall, there have been well-earned gains in the understanding of intensity change processes intrinsic to the TC system, but the journey is not complete. This paper highlights some of the most relevant and important research areas that are still shedding new light into internal factors governing TC intensity change.

  abstract: Assessing the role of anthropogenic warming from temporally inhomogeneous historical data in the presence of large natu- ral variability is difficult and has caused conflicting conclusions on detection and attribution of tropical cyclone (TC) trends. Here, using a reconstructed long-term proxy of annual TC numbers together with high-resolution climate model experiments, we show robust declining trends in the annual number of TCs at global and regional scales during the twentieth century. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) dataset is used for reconstruction because, compared with other reanalyses, it assimi- lates only sea-level pressure fields rather than utilize all available observations in the troposphere, making it less sensitive to temporal inhomogeneities in the observations. It can also capture TC signatures from the pre-satellite era reasonably well. The declining trends found are consistent with the twentieth century weakening of the Hadley and Walker circulations, which make conditions for TC formation less favourable.

  abstract: This study investigates the combined impacts of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) and extratropical anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking (AWB) on subseasonal Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) activity and their physical connections. Our results show that during MJO phases 2–3 (enhanced Indian Ocean convection) and 6–7 (enhanced tropical Pacific convection), there are significant changes in basinwide TC activity. The MJO and AWB collaborate to suppress basinwide TC activity during phases 6–7 but not during phases 2–3. During phases 6–7, when AWB occurs, various TC metrics including hurricanes, accumulated cyclone energy, and rapid intensification probability decrease by ∼50%–80%. Simultaneously, large-scale environmental variables, like vertical wind shear, precipitable water, and sea surface temperatures become extremely unfavorable for TC formation and intensification, compared to periods characterized by suppressed AWB activity during the same MJO phases. Further investigation reveals that AWB events during phases 6–7 occur in concert with the development of a stronger anticyclone in the lower troposphere, which transports more dry, stable extratropical air equatorward, and drives enhanced tropical SST cooling. As a result, individual AWB events in phases 6–7 can disturb the development of surrounding TCs to a greater extent than their phases 2–3 counterparts. The influence of the MJO on AWB over the western subtropical Atlantic can be attributed to the modulation of the convectively forced Rossby wave source over the tropical eastern Pacific. A significant number of Rossby waves initiating from this region during phases 5–6 propagate into the subtropical North Atlantic, preceding the occurrence of AWB events in phases 6–7.

  keypoint1: Rotation leads to a decreased intensity of the overturning circulation but increased mean precipitation and precipitable water 
  keypoint2: Static stability increases with rotation, net radiative cooling remains approximately constant, resulting in a smaller subsidence velocity
  keypoint3: Rotating experiments have a larger effective climate sensitivity relative to RCE experiments mostly due to longwave radiative changes
  abstract: This work explores the impact of rotation on tropical convection and climate. As our starting point, we use the RCEMIP experiments as control simulations and run additional simulations with rotation. Compared to radiative convective equilibrium (RCE) experiments, rotating RCE (RRCE) experiments have a more stable and humid atmosphere with higher precipitation rates. The intensity of the overturning circulation decreases, water vapor is cycled through the troposphere at a slower rate, the subsidence fraction decreases, and the climate sensitivity increases. Several of these changes can be attributed to an increased flux of latent and sensible heat that results from an increase of near‐surface wind speed with rotation shortly after model initialization. The increased climate sensitivity results from changes of both the longwave cloud radiative effect and the longwave clear‐sky radiative fluxes. This work demonstrates the sensitivity of atmospheric humidity and surface fluxes of moisture and temperature to rotation.
  summary: Many useful studies of the tropical regions of Earth have neglected to include rotation; however, phenomena such as tropical cyclones and atmospheric waves are fundamentally tied to rotation. This work compares models of the tropics with and without rotation. Compared to experiments without rotation, rotating experiments have a more humid and stable atmosphere. Although water vapor is cycled through the atmosphere at a slower rate, the precipitation rate increases. The climate sensitivity also increases due to changes in both clouds and water vapor. Many of these changes are the result of increased wind speeds. We argue that idealized modeling of Earth's tropical regions should include not just stationary experiments but also experiments that include rotation.
