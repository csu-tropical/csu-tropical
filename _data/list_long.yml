  keypoint1: The 1933 Atlantic hurricane season was extremely active, rivaling or exceeding the infamous 2005 season for several tropical cyclone parameters
  keypoint2: Large-scale environmental conditions in 1933 were very favorable, with warm tropical Atlantic SSTs and reduced vertical wind shear
  keypoint3: Current June and August statistical forecast models from CSU well-anticipated the heightened levels of activity observed in 1933
  abstract: The 1933 Atlantic hurricane season was extremely active, with 20 named storms and 11 hurricanes including 6 major (Category 3+; one-minute maximum sustained winds >=96 kt) hurricanes occurring. The 1933 hurricane season also generated the most Accumulated Cyclone Energy (an integrated metric that accounts for frequency, intensity, and duration) of any Atlantic hurricane season on record. A total of 8 hurricanes tracked through the Caribbean in 1933 - the most on record. In addition, two Category 3 hurricanes made landfall in the United States just 23 hours apart: the Treasure Coast hurricane in southeast Florida followed by the Cuba-Brownsville hurricane in south Texas.This manuscript examines large-scale atmospheric and oceanic conditions that likely led to such an active hurricane season. Extremely weak vertical wind shear was prevalent over both the Caribbean and the tropical Atlantic throughout the peak months of the hurricane season, likely in part due to a weak-to-moderate La Niña event. These favorable dynamic conditions, combined with above-normal tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures, created a very conducive environment for hurricane formation and intensification. The Madden-Julian oscillation was relatively active during the summer and fall of 1933, providing sub-seasonal conditions that were quite favorable for tropical cyclogenesis during mid-to-late August and late September to early October. The current early June and August statistical models used by Colorado State University would have predicted a very active 1933 hurricane season. A better understanding of these extremely active historical Atlantic hurricane seasons may aid in anticipation of future hyperactive seasons.
  summary: The Tropical Meteorology Project at Colorado State University (CSU), founded by the late Dr. William Gray, has been issuing seasonal Atlantic basin hurricane forecasts since 1984. These forecasts have primarily used statistical modeling approaches that take historical relationships between Atlantic hurricane activity and various climate features, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation and tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures. In this study, we use the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts System 5 (SEAS5) model to forecast the three large-scale predictors that currently comprise the early August statistical hurricane forecast model used by CSU. SEAS5 shows skill at forecasting each of these predictors during July from initialization as early as 1 March. The forecasted predictors from the dynamical model are then used to make a statistical forecast of Accumulated Cyclone Energy - an integrated metric accounting for intensity and duration of hurricane activity. The model shows skill at predicting Accumulated Cyclone Energy at all lead times, with improving skill as the lead time decreases. The combination of CSU’s currently-existing statistical models and the statistical/dynamical models detailed in this manuscript shows improved skill over either model individually for the early April, June and July outlooks, with the most notable improvement in early April.

  abstract: Observations of the air vertical velocities (wair) in supercell updrafts are presented, including uncertainty estimates, from radiosonde GPS measurements in two supercells. These in situ observations were collected during the Colorado State University Convective CLoud Outflows and UpDrafts Experiment (C3 15 LOUD-Ex) in moderately unstable environments in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. Based on the radiosonde accelerations, instances when the radiosonde balloon likely burst within the updraft are determined, and adjustments are made to account for the subsequent reduction in radiosonde buoyancy. Before and after these adjustments, the maximum estimated wair values are 36.2 and 49.9 m s-1 19 , respectively. Radar data are used to contextualize the in situ observations and suggest that most of the radiosonde observations were located several kilometers away from the most intense vertical motions. Therefore, the radiosonde-based wair values presented likely underestimate the maximum values within these storms due to these sampling biases, as well as the impacts from hydrometeors, which are not accounted for. When possible, radiosonde-based wair values were compared to estimates from dual-Doppler methods and from parcel theory. When the radiosondes observed their highest wair values, dual-Doppler methods generally produced 15-20 m s-1 26 lower wair for the same location, which could be related to the differences in the observing systems’ resolutions. In situ observations within supercell updrafts, which have been limited in recent decades, can be used to improve our understanding and modeling of storm dynamics. This study provides new in situ observations, as well as methods and lessons that could be applied to future field campaigns.

  abstract: Convective activity in Catalonia (northeastern Spain) mainly occurs during summer and autumn, with severe weather occurring 33 days per year on average. In some cases, the storms have unexpected propagation characteristics, likely due to a combination of the complex topography and the thunderstorms’ propagation mechanisms. Partly due to the local nature of the events, numerical weather prediction models are not able to accurately nowcast the complex mesoscale mechanisms (i.e., local influence of topography). This directly impacts the retrieved position and motion of the storms, and consequently, the likely associated storm severity. Although a successful warning system based on lightning and radar observations has been developed, there remains a lack of knowledge of storm dynamics that could lead to forecast improvements. The present study explores the capabilities of the radar network at the Meteorological Service of Catalonia to retrieve dual-Doppler wind fields to study the dynamics of Catalan thunderstorms. A severe thunderstorm that splits and a tornado-producing supercell that is channeled through a valley are used to demonstrate the capabilities of an advanced open source technique that retrieves dynamical variables from C-band operational radars in complex terrain. For the first time in the Iberian Peninsula, complete 3D storm-relative winds are obtained, providing information about the internal dynamics of the storms.  This aids in the analyses of the interaction between different storm cells within a system and/or the interaction of the cells with the local topography

    Polygonal eyewall asymmetries of Hurricane Michael (2018) during rapid intensification (RI) are analyzed from ground‐based single Doppler radar. Here, we present the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the axisymmetric and asymmetric winds at 5‐min intervals. Spectral time decomposition of the retrieved tangential wind structure shows quantitative evidence of low (1–4) azimuthal wavenumbers with propagation speeds that are consistent with linear wave theory on a radial vorticity gradient, suggesting the presence of rapidly evolving vortex Rossby waves. Dual‐Doppler winds from the NOAA P‐3 Hurricane Hunter airborne radar provide further evidence of the three‐dimensional vortex structure that supports growth of asymmetries during RI. Both reflectivity and tangential wind fields show polygonal structure and propagate at similar speeds, suggesting a close coupling of the dynamics and the convective organization during the intensification.
  summary: >
    Understanding tropical cyclone (TC) structure and evolution are crucial for improving weather forecasts. Hurricane Michael (2018) was observed by radar imagery to have an evolving polygonal eyewall with elliptical, triangular, and square shapes during rapid intensification (RI). While polygonal eyewall shapes have been seen in previous hurricanes, the corresponding evolution of wind asymmetries has never been quantitatively deduced due to limitations from previous observations. Here, we present the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the winds at 5‐min intervals from single‐Doppler Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) observations. The results highlight the value of coastal radar observations to investigate physical mechanisms of TC intensity and structure evolution and will help to improve intensity forecasts in the future.

  title: Relationship between spring tropical cyclone frequency over the western North Pacific and El Niño-Southern Oscillation

  keypoint1: More tropical cyclones form in the western North Pacific during the boreal spring in La Niña years versus El Niño years
  keypoint2: Increased mid-level moisture appears to be primary reason for increased TC activity in La Niña springs
  keypoint3: false
  abstract: The number of tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific (WNP) during spring (March-May) has a significant inverse correlation with concurrent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions during the period from 1979-2018. This relationship is different from the previously-documented weak relationship between TC frequency and ENSO during the climatologically most active portion of the TC season. In general, TCs seldom occur in El Niño years during March-May, whereas they frequently form over the western part of the WNP, particularly to the southeast of the Philippines, in La Niña years. This difference can be largely explained by ENSO-driven differences in the genesis potential index as derived from environmental variables. In La Niña years, the abnormally moist mid-troposphere, which relates to the strengthened vertical transport of water vapor induced by the enhanced Walker Circulation, primarily favors TC development, while increased sea surface temperatures and positive low-level relative vorticity anomalies appear to play a lesser role in impacting TC formation.

  title: Factors affecting the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season and the role of the Indian Ocean Dipole

  keypoint1: Most 2019 Atlantic tropical cyclone activity occurred during a six-week period of conducive environmental conditions.
  keypoint2: The subtropical Atlantic was more favorable than normal for tropical cyclones.
  keypoint3: The strongly positive Indian Ocean Dipole likely contributed to below-normal Atlantic tropical cyclone activity in October.
  abstract: The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season exhibited above-average Accumulated Cyclone Energy<97>60% of which was produced by Hurricanes Dorian and Lorenzo. Most tropical cyclone (TC) activity was concentrated in a ~6-week period from late August to early October. During the early part of the season, relatively TC-unfavorable conditions persisted in the maindevelopment region (MDR). The MDR environment became largely favorable in September followed by an abrupt shift back to less conducive conditions in October coincident with a strongly positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The IOD produced an El Niño-like teleconnection pattern observed through 200-hPa velocity potential anomalies. In the subtropical Atlantic, above-average sea surface temperatures persisted for much of the season, which may have contributed to increased activity at higher latitudes. Given the neutral El Niño-Southern Oscillation conditions during the 2019 hurricane season, our study highlights the need for further analysis of IOD impacts on Atlantic TC activity.
  summary: In 2019, the Atlantic produced above-average activity according to Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE), an index that captures storm intensity and longevity. The two strongest hurricanes, Dorian and Lorenzo, contributed 60% of the season<92>s total ACE. Most storms occurred in an active 6-week period from late August to early October when the environment became more favorable for hurricanes. But after that, conditions became less favorable when the western Indian Ocean became much warmer than normal and the eastern Indian Ocean became much colder than normal, an oceanic phenomenon referred to as a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. This strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole event produced sinking air across much of the tropics, including the Atlantic, a pattern that is El Niño-like. Since knowledge of El Niño helps us predict Atlantic seasonal hurricane activity, it is possible that understanding more about the Indian Ocean Dipole<92>s impacts on Atlantic hurricane activity will help us improve seasonal hurricane forecasts.

  keypoint1: Bay of Bengal TC activity is significantly enhanced when the convectively
    active MJO phase is positioned over the eastern Indian Ocean and the Maritime
    Continent
  keypoint2: Bay of Bengal TC activity is significantly suppressed when the convectively
    active MJO phase is positioned over the Western Hemisphere and Africa
  keypoint3: MJO modulations of Bay of Bengal TC activity are stronger in the post-monsoon
    than pre-monsoon cyclone season
  abstract: The influence of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) on global tropical
    cyclone (TC) activity has been well documented in many earlier studies. However,
    no prior studies have focused specifically on the MJO's impacts on TCs in the
    Bay of Bengal (BoB). Therefore, the present study examines the impact of the MJO
    on BoB TC activity during the two peak TC periods i.e. April–June (AMJ) and October–December
    (OND) from 1974 to 2015. The MJO considerably modulates various measures of TC
    activity in the BoB, including the number of TCs, the number of TC days, accumulated
    cyclone energy, the power dissipation index, TC genesis location and TC tracks.
    TC activity is significantly enhanced (suppressed) over the BoB when the convectively
    active MJO phase is positioned over the eastern Indian Ocean and the Maritime
    Continent (the Western Hemisphere and Africa). Alterations in the TC genesis locations
    and their tracks are more pronounced in OND than in AMJ. These changes in TC characteristics
    are mainly attributed to MJO-driven modulations in large-scale environmental conditions
    such as deep convection, mid-tropospheric relative humidity, sea surface temperature,
    sea level pressure, lower and upper-level winds and vertical wind shear. A comprehensive
    knowledge of the MJO-TC relationship may be beneficial for short-term predictions
    of TC activity in the BoB.

  abstract: Here we discuss recent progress in understanding tropical cyclone (TC)
    subseasonal variability and its prediction. There has been a concerted effort
    to understand the sources of predictability at subseasonal time-scales, and this
    effort has continued to make progress in recent years. Besides the Madden-Julian
    Oscillation (MJO), other modes of variability affect TCs at these time-scales,
    in particular various equatorial waves. Additionally, TC activity is also modulated
    by extratropical processes via Rossby wave breaking. There has also been progress
    in the ability of models to simulate the MJO and its modulation of TC activity.
    Community efforts have created multi-model ensemble datasets, which have made
    it possible to evaluate the forecast skill of the MJO and TCs on subseasonal time-scales
    in multiple forecasting systems. While there is positive skill in some cases,
    there is strong dependence on the ensemble system considered, the basin examined,
    and whether the storms have extratropical influences or not. Furthermore, the
    definition of skill differs among studies. Forecasting centers are currently issuing
    subseasonal TC forecasts using various techniques (statistical, statistical-dynamical
    and dynamical). There is also a strong interest in the private sector for forecasts
    with 3-4 weeks lead time.

  title: Relationship between the Pacific-North American pattern and the frequency
    of tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific

  keypoint1: Boreal summer western North Pacific tropical cyclone frequency is inversely
    linked to the concurrent Pacific-North American pattern
  keypoint2: A greater number of tropical cyclones form north (south) of 12.5°N during
    low (high) Pacific-North American pattern phases
  keypoint3: The Pacific-North American pattern influences tropical cyclone genesis
    predominately by modulating large-scale dynamic conditions
  abstract: The frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific
    during June–November has a significant inverse correlation with the concurrent
    Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern from 1965 to 2016. During low PNA years,
    more TCs form north of 12.5°N, with significantly greater  TC occurrences from
    15 to 20°N, compared to high PNA years. The difference in TC genesis location
    can be explained by the differences in the genesis potential index derived from
    the environmental variables in both PNA phases. The PNA influences TC formation
    primarily by modulating large-scale dynamic conditions, with thermodynamic conditions
    playing a lesser role. In low PNA years, low-level anomalous cyclonic lows over
    the Philippines and in the subtropical central Pacific provide significant positive
    relative vorticity anomalies favorable for TC genesis. Additionally, there is
    also less vertical wind shear to the north of the Philippines due to enhanced
    winds at low levels and weaker winds at upper levels.
  summary: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are the most devastating natural disasters in many
    coastal regions, including over the western North Pacific (WNP). Therefore, the
    characteristics and driving mechanisms of WNP TC activity have been studied extensively
    over the past several decades. Previous publications indicated that El Niño-Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) played the most important role on an interannual basis in modulating
    WNP TC formation, movement, and intensity. However, the interannual frequency
    of WNP TCs is only weakly influenced by ENSO. Here we find that there exists a
    significant negative correlation between the annual number of boreal summer WNP
    TCs and the concurrent Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. Distinct from other
    climate modes (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation),
    the inverse relationship between WNP TC frequency and the PNA is relatively stable
    and independent of the period analyzed. Furthermore, the PNA influences the formation
    of WNP TCs through a modulation of the large-scale environment, particularly the
    dynamic conditions. During low PNA years, the large-scale dynamic conditions are
    more favorable for TC development, compared to high PNA years. Our results imply

  abstract: Rapid intensification (RI) refers to a significant increase in tropical
    cyclone (TC) intensity over a short period of time. A TC can also undergo multiple
    RI events during its lifetime, and these RI events pose a significant challenge
    for operational forecasting. The long-term tendency in RI magnitude of TCs over
    the western North Pacific is investigated in this study. During 1979-2018, a significant
    increasing trend is found in RI magnitude, which primarily results from the significant
    increasing number of strong RI events, defined as 24-h intensity increases of
    at least 50 kt. Furthermore, there are significantly more (slightly fewer) strong
    RI occurrences west (east) of 155°E in 1999-2018 than in 1979-1998. Significant
    increases in strong RI occurrences are located over the region bounded by 10°~20°N,
    120°~150°E. These changes are likely induced by the warming ocean but appear uncorrelated
    with changes in the atmospheric environment. By contrast, there are slight decreases
    in strong RI occurrences over the region bounded by 12.5°~22.5°N, 155°~170°E,
    likely due to the offset between RI-favorable influences of the warming ocean
    and RI-unfavorable influences of increasing vertical wind shear (VWS).

  title: Revisiting the relationship between tropical cyclone size and intensity over
    the western North Pacific

  abstract: This study revisits the nonlinear relationship between tropical cyclone
    (TC) size and intensity over the western North Pacific (WNP). Using best track
    data from the Japan Meteorological Agency from 2007‐2019, we find that the statistical
    turning point on a fitted size‐intensity curve only exists for TCs with greater
    lifetime peak intensities (e.g. typhoons). The track and evolution type are two
    factors determining the statistical size‐intensity relationship. The nonlinear
    size‐intensity relationship is only observed for recurving typhoons reaching their
    peak intensities and sizes at different times, due to a non‐monotonic size change
    during the weakening stage. The slight size decrease in the initial weakening
    stage can be linked to a TC weakening‐induced shrinkage balanced by a baroclinic
    expansion when recurving typhoons move into higher latitudes. Finally, different
    evolution types for WNP typhoons can be determined by the ratio of intensity/size
    to its theoretical maximum.
  summary: Tropical cyclone (TC) size and intensity are two primary metrics determining
    the destructive potential of a TC. Previous studies have reported a nonlinear
    size‐intensity relationship, in which TC size substantially increases with intensity
    to an upper bound and then remains constant or even decreases with increasing
    intensity. Using best tracks from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) for 2007‐2019,
    we find that this statistical nonlinear size‐intensity relationship only occurs
    for TCs with stronger lifetime maximum intensities (e.g. typhoons). Whether the
    size‐intensity relationship is linear or nonlinear is jointly determined by the
    track that the TC takes and its evolution type on a size‐intensity diagram. There
    is a linear size‐intensity relationship for recurving typhoons reaching their
    peak intensities and sizes simultaneously and for typhoons that are relatively
    straight‐moving. For other recurving typhoons, the nonlinear size‐intensity relationship
    is primarily caused by a nonlinear size decrease during the weakening stage. We
    speculate that, as recurving typhoons move poleward, weakening TCs often begin
    to shrink, while the interaction between the TC and the midlatitude circulation
    leads to a baroclinic expansion of TC size. Finally, different evolution types
    for WNP typhoons can be determined by the ratio of intensity/size to its theoretical
    maximum.

  title: The record-setting 2018 eastern North Pacific hurricane season

  keypoint1: The eastern North Pacific set records for hurricane activity in 2018
    with relatively little influence from El Niño-Southern Oscillation
  keypoint2: Combined above (below)-average sea surface temperatures and moisture
    (shear) during August and September contributed to the record season
  keypoint3: The strongly positive Pacific Meridional Mode also supported the increase
    in eastern North Pacific hurricane activity
  abstract: The extremely active 2018 eastern North Pacific (ENP) hurricane season
    set records for number of hurricane days, major hurricane days, and accumulated
    cyclone energy (ACE). The Western Development Region (116°W–180°) was especially
    active, shattering its prior record for ACE set in 2015. In addition, Hawaii was
    impacted by Hurricane Lane in August and Tropical Storm Olivia in September. Despite
    above-normal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and below-normal vertical wind shear
    in 2018, large-scale conditions were generally less conducive for tropical cyclone
    (TC) formation than in 2015. However, the strong subtropical ridge in August and
    September of 2018 enhanced westward steering flow, thereby keeping TCs over hurricane-favorable
    conditions and preventing recurvature toward lower SSTs and higher vertical wind
    shear. The 2018 ENP hurricane season highlights that El Niño conditions are not
    necessary for extremely high ENP TC activity.
  summary: The 2018 eastern North Pacific hurricane season broke records, particularly
    when considering an index that accounts for frequency, intensity, and duration
    of hurricanes. The previous record was set in 2015 during a strong El Niño event
    that increased ocean warmth and thus provided more fuel for hurricanes. Even though
    a weak El Niño did not develop until late in the 2018 hurricane season, the ocean
    was warmer than normal in the region where the hurricanes formed, which helped
    support their development. After the hurricanes formed, the flow of the atmosphere
    generally kept them over warmer water, helping them last longer. We need to study
    more seasons like 2018 to better understand when eastern North Pacific hurricane
    seasons will be active without the presence of a strong El Niño.

  abstract: The tropical cyclone (TC)-centric approach developed in previous studies
    tends to overemphasize the direct impact of tropical waves and underestimates
    their large-scale modulation of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclogenesis
    (TCG). To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new approach based
    on empirical orthogonal function analyses to re-examine associations of multiple
    waves, including the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), quasi-biweekly oscillation
    (QBWO), convective equatorial Rossby (ER) waves, and synoptic scale waves (SSWs),
    with WNP TCG events. There is a close association between WNP TCG events (total
    of 273 TCs in this study) and SSWs (~ 64%), MJO (~ 68%), QBWO (~ 64%) and ER (~ 65%)
    waves. These suggest that SSW is critical for many TCG events, and all of these
    intra-seasonal waves significantly modulate TCG events. A majority of TCs (~ 79%)
    were found to be related to more than one wave type, indicating an important role
    for a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic conditions associated with multiple
    waves in TCG events. Further analyses show that SSW activity is strongly modulated
    by the MJO and ER waves, while the QBWO has no significant impact on SSWs. During
    convectively active MJO and ER phases, stronger SSW trains with more distinct
    southeast-northwestward aligned structures can be found compared to convectively
    inactive phases. Similar intra-seasonal modulation of the transition from the
    mixed Rossby-gravity waves from the equatorial central Pacific to the SSW trains
    over the WNP by the three waves is noted, with such transitions largely favored
    during convectively active MJO and ER phases.

  title: Recent increased co-variability of tropical cyclogenesis latitude-longitude

  keypoint1: Increasing covariability of western North Pacific tropical cylogenesis
    latitude-longitude has been observed since 1998
  keypoint2: Strengthening of the relationship may be due to changing ENSO conditions,
    with Central Pacific El Nino events more common since 1998
  keypoint3: Changes in tropical Indian Ocean SST may also play a role in the observed
    changing cyclogenesis latitude-longitude relationship
  abstract: This study examines interdecadal changes in the interannual relationship
    between the extended boreal summer (May–November) tropical cyclogenesis (TCG)
    latitude and longitude over the western North Pacific Ocean (WNP) during 1979–2016.
    Increasing covariability of WNP TCG latitude and longitude is observed since 1998,
    which is found to be closely linked to shifting ENSO conditions and a tropical
    Pacific climate regime shift. Accompanied by an increasing occurrence in central
    Pacific (CP) ENSO events during recent decades, there has been a more consistent
    northwestward or southeastward shift of WNP TCG location since 1998. These coherent
    latitude and longitude shifts were generally not evident during 1979–97, a period
    characterized by a more conventional eastern Pacific (EP) ENSO pattern. Our statistical
    results show a robust relationship between TCG latitude and the Hadley circulation
    and between longitude and the Walker circulation during the period prior to and
    since the regime shift, and a possible physical explanation for the recent increased
    covariability of TCG latitude and longitude is given. During 1998–2016, there
    is a significant association of CP ENSO events with the intensity of both the
    Hadley and Walker circulations that likely caused the recent increase in the covariability
    of TCG latitude and longitude. However, the strong association of EP ENSO events
    with the intensity of the Hadley circulation but not with the Walker circulation
    during 1979–97 weakened the covariability of TCG latitude and longitude. In addition,
    changes in tropical Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures appear to also importantly
    contribute to the recent increased covariability of WNP TCG location.

  keypoint1: Interannual relationship between the western North Pacific monsoon and
    western North Pacific tropical cyclone frequency has increased since 1998
  keypoint2: false
  keypoint3: false
  abstract: This study examines the association between the western North Pacific
    (WNP) summer monsoon (WNPSM) and WNP tropical cyclone (TC) frequency during June–August
    from 1979 to 2016. The interannual relationship between the WNPSM and the total
    number of WNP TCs has strengthened since 1998. There has also been a significant
    reduction in the number of TCs forming within the WNP monsoon trough (WNPMT)—hereafter
    called ITCs, for internal or inside TCs—since 1998. These two important features
    are found to be closely associated with the climate regime shift that occurred
    around 1998. During 1998–2016, the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) tended to
    be in a cold phase, with an increasing occurrence of central Pacific–type El Niño–Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) events, whereas the 1979–97 period tended to be characterized
    by a warm phase of the PDO and east Pacific–type ENSO events. During 1998–2016,
    the tropical Pacific was characterized by enhanced easterlies, which led to a
    westward-retreated WNPMT that caused a significant decrease in ITCs over the WNP
    basin. However, there was little change in TCs outside of the WNPMT region (hereafter
    called OTCs) compared to that before 1998. A significant in-phase (out-of-phase)
    relationship between the WNPSM and the number of ITCs (OTCs) is observed before
    1998, thus greatly weakening the WNPSM–TC relationship. The recent enhanced relationship
    between the WNPSM and TCs is mainly due to a strong in-phase relationship between
    the WNPSM and ITCs. The interannual change in ITCZ is mainly controlled by WNPSM
    changes since 1998, while OTC changes are mainly modulated by changes in the tropical
    upper-tropospheric trough.

  keypoint1: Relationship between ENSO and Western North Pacific tropical cyclone
    season onset changed in the late 1990s
  keypoint2: Strong El Nino events have been associated with late starting Western
    North Pacific tropical cyclone seasons throughout the satellite era
  keypoint3: false
  abstract: Most studies have focused on variations of tropical cyclone (TC) frequency,
    intensity, and track over the western North Pacific (WNP), but variability of
    WNP TC season onset date (TCSO) has been less studied. Recent research has indicated
    a close association between WNP TCSO and sea surface temperature (SST) over the
    tropical Indian Ocean and the tropical central-eastern Pacific. This study has
    found that relationship between TCSO and SST underwent an inter-decadal change
    in the late 1990s, likely due to a climate shift that occurred around that time.
    An observed significant correlation between TCSO and SST before the late 1990s
    has been insignificant since that time. This was confirmed by the fact that El
    Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at 0.46 positively correlates with TCSO from
    1965 – 1999 (significant at the 95 % level), and the correlation becomes insignificant
    (0.16) during 1998 – 2016. Further analysis suggests that the close association
    between TCSO and SST is robust only for major El Niño events, with consistently
    extreme late TCSO following major El Niños during the satellite era. Accompanying
    the decay of major El Niños, tropical equatorial easterly anomalies in the WNP
    are driven by a Matsuno–Gill-type response to the specific SST anomaly pattern
    over the tropical Indo–Pacific sector. This in turn induces an anomalous anticyclone,
    anomalous westerly vertical wind shear, reduced mid-level moisture and suppressed
    convection over the WNP basin—all of which are unfavorable for WNP TCs, resulting
    in delayed TCSO following major El Niño events. These inter-decadal changes in
    the inter-annual correlation between TCSO and ENSO are largely due to the changing
    influence of moderate El Niño events on TCSO before and after the late 1990s.
    This study improves understanding of the ENSO–TC relationship, which should aid
    seasonal outlooks of WNP TC activity.

  keypoint1: Pressure is more skillful than maximum sustained wind at predicting normalized
    hurricane damage for the continental US from 1900-2018
  keypoint2: Pressure is more akin to an integrated metric than is maximum sustained
    wind and consequently is a more accurate metric of overall storm intensity
  keypoint3: Pressure is also much easier to measure than maximum sustained wind,
    both with aircraft as well as with surface observations
  abstract: Atlantic hurricane seasons have a long history of causing significant
    financial impacts, with Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, and Michael combining to
    incur more than 345 billion USD in direct economic damage during 2017-2018.  While
    Michael’s damage was primarily wind and storm surge-driven, Florence’s and Harvey’s
    damage was predominantly rainfall and inland flood-driven.  Several revised scales
    have been proposed to replace the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS),
    which currently only categorizes the hurricane wind threat, while not explicitly
    handling the totality of storm impacts including storm surge and rainfall. However,
    most of these newly-proposed scales are not easily calculated in real-time, nor
    can they be reliably calculated historically. In particular, they depend on storm
    wind radii, which remain very uncertain. Herein, we analyze the relationship between
    normalized historical damage caused by continental United States (CONUS) landfalling
    hurricanes from 1900-2018 with both maximum sustained wind speed (Vmax) and minimum
    sea level pressure (MSLP).  We show that MSLP is a more skillful predictor of
    normalized damage than Vmax, with a significantly higher rank correlation between
    normalized damage and MSLP (rrank = 0.77) than between normalized damage and Vmax
    (rrank = 0.66) for all CONUS landfalling hurricanes.  MSLP has served as a much
    better predictor of hurricane damage in recent years than Vmax, with large hurricanes
    such as Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012) causing much more damage than anticipated
    from their SSHWS ranking. MSLP is also a more accurately-measured quantity than
    is Vmax, making it an ideal quantity for evaluating a hurricane’s potential damage.

  # Abstract of the paper.
  abstract: Observations from the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in
    the Tropics (PREDICT), Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), and
    Intensity Forecast Experiment (IFEX) field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010). Research aircraft missions provided Doppler radar, in situ flight level,
    and dropsonde data documenting the structural changes of the predepression disturbance.
    Following the pre-Karl wave pouch, variational analyses at the meso-β and meso-α
    scales suggest that the convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and
    midlevel circulations leading to genesis episodically rather than through a sustained
    lowering of the convective mass flux from increased stabilization. Convective
    bursts that erupt in the vorticity-rich environment of the recirculating pouch
    region enhance the low-level meso-β- and meso-α-scale circulation through vortex
    stretching. As the convection wanes, the resulting stratiform precipitation strengthens
    the midlevel circulation through convergence associated with ice microphysical
    processes, protecting the disturbance from the intrusion of dry environmental
    air. Once the column saturation fraction returns to a critical value, a subsequent
    convective burst below the midlevel circulation further enhances the low-level
    circulation, and the convective cycle repeats. The analyses suggest that the onset
    of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely related to the
    coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels. Our interpretation
    of the observational analysis presented in this study reaffirms a primary role
    of deep convection in the genesis process and provides a hypothesis for the supporting
    role of stratiform precipitation and the midlevel vortex.

  keypoint1: Rain drop size distributions in Harvey and Florence were broadly similar
    to other tropical cyclones
  keypoint2: High-concentrations of midsize drops were more common and widespread
    in Harvey than in Florence
  keypoint3: Harvey's rainfall was more intense and asymmetric due to vertical wind
    shear and a weaker intensity
  abstract: Polarimetric coastal radar data are used to compare the rainfall characteristics
    of Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Florence (2018). Intense rainfall was an infrequent
    yet important contributor to the total rainfall in Harvey, but its relative contribution
    varied spatially. The total rainfall over land maximized near the coast over Beaumont,
    TX due to intense convection resulting from prolonged onshore flow downshear from
    the circulation center. Overall, polarimetric radar observations in Harvey show
    a dominance of high concentrations of small-to-medium drops, consistent with prior
    tropical cyclone studies. The microphysical characteristics were spatially and
    temporally inhomogeneous however, with larger drops more frequent on 27 August
    and higher number concentrations more frequent on 28 and 30 August. The polarimetric
    variables and raindrop characteristics observed during Florence share broad similarities
    to Harvey, but had reduced variability, fewer observations of stronger reflectivity
    and differential reflectivity, and a lower frequency of high number concentrations
    and medium-sized drops. The radar data indicate Florence had reduced coverage
    of stronger convection compared to Harvey. We hypothesize that differences in
    storm motion, intensity decay rates, and vertical wind shear produce the distinct
    precipitation structures and microphysical differences seen in Harvey and Florence.

  # Keypoints of Paper & Abstract
  keypoint1: Anti-cyclonic wave breaking (AWB) activity is shown to be associated
    with the second leading EOF mode in tropical North Atlantic vertical wind shear
    (VWS) and accounts for 23% of the structured variance.
  keypoint2: While the tropical sources of VWS from ENSO and the AMM remain the dominant
    drivers of tropical North Atlantic VWS, the extratropical sources of VWS from
    AWB are an important contribution to tropical and subtropical VWS variability
    and tropical cyclone (TC) activity.
  keypoint3: VWS anomalies induced by AWB activity may be a suitable indicator of
    AWB impacts on VWS and its subsequent influence on seasonal TC activity.
  abstract: Given recent insights into the role of anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking
    (AWB) in driving subseasonal and seasonal North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC)
    activity, this study further examines tropical versus subtropical impacts on TC
    activity by considering large-scale influences on boreal summer tropical zonal
    vertical wind shear (VWS) variability, a key predictor of seasonal TC activity.
    Through an empirical orthogonal function analysis, it is shown that subtropical
    AWB activity drives the second mode of variability in tropical zonal VWS, while
    El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) primarily drives the leading mode of variability.
    Linear regressions of the four leading principal components against tropical North
    Atlantic zonal VWS and accumulated cyclone energy show that, while the leading
    mode holds much of the regression strength, some improvement can be achieved with
    the addition of the second and third modes. Furthermore, an index of AWB-associated
    VWS anomalies, a proxy for AWB impacts on the large-scale environment, may be
    a better indicator of summertime VWS anomalies. The utilization of this index
    may be used to better understand AWB’s contribution to seasonal TC activity.

  keypoint1: This manuscript examines the relationship between the QBO and the MJO
    during the boreal winter and finds that the strong relationship observed in recent
    years did not exist prior to the mid 1970s.  We hypothesize that climate change
    has strengthened the relationship between the MJO and QBO.
  keypoint2: false
  keypoint3: false
  abstract: A strong relationship between the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of
    equatorial stratospheric winds and the amplitude of the Madden-Julian oscillation
    (MJO) during the boreal winter has recently been uncovered using observational
    data from the mid-1970s to the present. When the QBO is in its easterly phase
    in the lower stratosphere, it favors stronger MJO activity during boreal winter,
    while the MJO tends to be weaker during the westerly phase of the QBO. Here we
    show using reconstructed indices of the MJO and QBO back to 1905 that the relationship
    between enhanced boreal winter MJO activity and the easterly phase of the QBO
    has only emerged since the early 1980s. The emergence of this relationship coincides
    with the recent cooling trend in the equatorial lower stratosphere and the warming
    trend in the equatorial upper troposphere, which appears to have sensitized MJO
    convective activity to QBO-induced changes in static stability near the tropopause.
    Climate change is thus suggested to have played a role in promoting coupling between
    the MJO and the QBO.

  abstract: This paper summarizes the forecast methods, outputs and skill offered
    by twelve agencies for seasonal tropical cyclone (TC) activity around the world.
    These agencies use a variety of techniques ranging from statistical models to
    dynamical models to predict basinwide activity and regional activity. In addition,
    several dynamical and hybrid statistical/dynamical models now predict TC track
    density as well as landfall likelihood. Realtime Atlantic seasonal hurricane forecasts
    have shown low skill in April, modest skill in June and good skill in August at
    predicting basinwide TC activity when evaluated over 2003-2018. Real-time western
    North Pacific seasonal TC forecasts have shown good skill by July for basinwide
    intense typhoon numbers and the ACE index when evaluated for 2003-2018. Both hindcasts
    and real-time forecasts have shown skill for other TC basins. A summary of recent
    research into forecasting TC activity beyond seasonal (e.g., multi-year) timescales
    is included. Recommendations for future areas of research are also discussed.

    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010).
  keypoint2: The onset of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely

    circulations leading to genesis episodically.
  abstract: Observations from the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in
    the Tropics (PREDICT), Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), and
    Intensity Forecast Experiment (IFEX) field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010). Research aircraft missions provided Doppler radar, in situ flight level,
    and dropsonde data documenting the structural changes of the predepression disturbance.
    Following the pre-Karl wave pouch, variational analyses at the meso-β and meso-α
    scales suggest that the convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and
    midlevel circulations leading to genesis episodically rather than through a sustained
    lowering of the convective mass flux from increased stabilization. Convective
    bursts that erupt in the vorticity-rich environment of the recirculating pouch
    region enhance the low-level meso-β- and meso-α-scale circulation through vortex
    stretching. As the convection wanes, the resulting stratiform precipitation strengthens
    the midlevel circulation through convergence associated with ice microphysical
    processes, protecting the disturbance from the intrusion of dry environmental
    air. Once the column saturation fraction returns to a critical value, a subsequent
    convective burst below the midlevel circulation further enhances the low-level
    circulation, and the convective cycle repeats. The analyses suggest that the onset
    of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely related to the
    coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels. Our interpretation
    of the observational analysis presented in this study reaffirms a primary role
    of deep convection in the genesis process and provides a hypothesis for the supporting
    role of stratiform precipitation and the midlevel vortex.

  keypoint1: This study examines the interactions of a pre-depression Hagupit with
    vertical wind shear (VWS) at various spatial scales from synoptic to meso-scales
    using field observations.
  keypoint2: We highlight the persistent convection maintaining moisture and vorticity
    inside the wave pouch even under 20 m/s deep-layer VWS.
  keypoint3: Our interpretation of the radar and dropsonde analyses provides a new
    insight for the supporting role of low-level VWS providing horizontal vorticity
    and organizing convection in the early stage of tropical cyclogenesis.
  abstract: >
    The impact of vertical wind shear (VWS) on cyclogenesis is examined from the synoptic
    to meso scales using airborne Doppler radar observations of pre-depression Hagupit
    during Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 (TCS08) / THORPEX Pacific Area Regional
    Campaign (T-PARC) field campaigns. The high temporal and spatial resolution observations
    reveal complex localized convective and vortical characteristics of a pre-depression
    in a sheared environment. Pre-depression Hagupit interacted with an upper-tropospheric
    trough during the observation period. The strong deep-layer VWS (> 20 m s -1)
    had a negative impact on the development through misalignment of the low and mid-level
    circulations and dry air intrusion. However, the low-level circulation persisted
    and the system ultimately formed into a tropical cyclone after it left the high-shear
    zone. Here we propose that a key process that enabled the predepression to survive
    through the upper-tropospheric trough interaction was persistent vorticity amplification
    on the meso-gamma scale that was aggregated on the mesoalpha scale within the
    pouch. Multi-Doppler wind analysis indicates that cumulus congestus tilted the
    low-level horizontal vorticity into the vertical in the early stage of convective
    life-cycle, followed by stretching from maturing deep convection. Variations in
    low-level VWS on the meso-beta scale affect convective organization and horizontal
    vorticity generation. The results provide new insights into multi-scale processes
    during TC genesis and the interactions of a pre-depression with VWS at various
    spatial scales.

  title: Quantifying the Probability and Causes of the Surprisingly Active 2018 North
    Atlantic hurricane season

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EA000852
  keypoint1: The 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season witnessed activity 25% above
    the long-term average, due mainly to high activity in the subtropics
  keypoint2: The environmental fields that explain most variance in long-term hurricane
    activity all predicted a below-normal 2018 hurricane season
  keypoint3: The 2018 hurricane season highlights the need for seasonal hurricane
    outlooks to be issued in terms of probability of exceedance
  abstract: The 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season was a destructive season with
    hurricanes Florence and Michael causing significant damage in the southeastern
    United States. In keeping with most destructive hurricane seasons, basinwide tropical
    cyclone activity was above average in 2018?by ~25% for named storm numbers, hurricane
    numbers, and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE). In contrast to this above-normal
    activity, the August?September tropical environmental fields that explain ~50%
    of the variance in Atlantic basin hurricane activity between 1950 and 2017 anticipated
    a well below-average 2018 hurricane season. The surprisingly large mismatch between
    the observed and replicated levels of hurricane activity in 2018 is an extreme
    example of the uncertainty inherent in seasonal hurricane outlooks and highlights
    the need for these outlooks to be issued in terms of probability of exceedance.
    Such probabilistic information would better clarify the uncertainty associated
    with hurricane outlooks to the benefit of users. With retrospective knowledge
    of the August?September 2018 key tropical environmental fields, the chance that
    the observed 2018 Atlantic hurricane activity would occur is about 5%. The reasons
    for the surprisingly high hurricane activity in 2018 are a hurricane outbreak
    in early September and, in particular, the occurrence of unusually high tropical
    cyclone activity in the subtropical North Atlantic. The hyperactive subtropical
    activity was not anticipated because contemporary statistical models of seasonal
    Atlantic hurricane activity lack skill in anticipating subtropical ACE compared
    to tropical ACE.
  summary: Seasonal outlooks for North Atlantic hurricane activity contribute to the
    anticipation of risk for insurance companies, other weather-sensitive businesses,
    and local and national governments. However, the uncertainty associated with such
    forecasts is often unclear. This reduces their benefit and contributes to the
    perception of forecast “busts.” The issue is highlighted by the destructive and
    surprising 25% above-average 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. Retrospective examination
    of the key August–September 2018 environmental fields that explain ~50% of long‐term
    Atlantic hurricane activity shows that all were consistent with a well below‐average
    2018 hurricane season. A below‐normal season was also anticipated by hurricane
    outlooks issued in early August 2018. The large mismatch between the observed
    and replicated levels of hurricane activity in 2018 is an extreme example of the
    uncertainty inherent in hurricane outlooks. We show that this uncertainty may
    be properly clarified by expressing outlooks in terms of probability of exceedance.
    The likelihood that the observed 2018 hurricane activity would occur with retrospective
    knowledge of the key environmental fields is about 5%. Hyperactive storm activity
    in the subtropical North Atlantic contributed to the surprisingly active 2018
    hurricane season. The unusual subtropical activity was not anticipated because
    statistical models lack skill in anticipating such activity.

  title: A Statistical Seasonal Forecast Model of North Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclones
    using the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.5853
  keypoint1: This manuscript proposes using the QBO to model cyclone tracks over the
    North Indian Ocean
  keypoint2: More North Indian Ocean TCs were found to form when the QBO was in its
    east phase than when the QBO was in its west phase, and these TCs were more likely
    to track westward and northwestward.
  keypoint3: Alternatively, when the QBO was in its west phase, TCs were more likely
    to track northward and northeastward.
  abstract: Previous studies have shown that the skill of seasonal forecasts of tropical
    cyclone (TC) activity over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) tends to be poor. This
    paper investigates the forecast potential of TC formation, trajectories and points
    of landfall in the NIO region using an index of the stratospheric quasi-biennial
    oscillation (QBO) as the predictor variable in a new statistical seasonal forecast
    model. Genesis was modelled by kernel density estimation, tracks were fitted using
    a generalized additive model (GAM) approach with an Euler integration step, and
    landfall location was estimated using a country mask. The model was trained on
    30 years of TC observations (1980–2009) from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center
    and the QBO index at lags from 0 to 6 months. Over this time period, and within
    each season and QBO phase, the kernel density estimator modelled the distribution
    of genesis points, and the cyclone trajectories were then fit by the GAM along
    the observed cyclone tracks as smooth functions of location. Trajectories were
    simulated from randomly selected genesis points in the kernel density estimates.
    Ensembles of cyclone paths were traced, taking account of random innovations every
    6-hr along the GAM-fitted velocity fields, to determine the points of landfall.
    Lead–lag analysis was used to assess the best predictor timescales for TC forecast
    potential. We found that the best model utilized the QBO index with a 3-month
    lead. Two hindcast validation methods were applied. First, leave-one-out cross-validation
    was performed where the country of landfall was decided by the majority vote of
    the simulated tracks. Second, the distances between the landfall locations in
    the observations and simulations were calculated. Application of seasonal forecast
    analysis further indicated that including information on the state of the QBO
    has the potential to improve the skill of TC seasonal forecasts in the NIO region.

  keypoint1: This manuscript investigated the roles of several different atmospheric
    wave types on western North Pacific TC formation
  keypoint2: Nearly 80% of western North Pacific TCs were a result of two or more
    different wave types
  keypoint3: When the convectively-enhanced phases of the MJO and equatorial Rossby
    waves were present, synoptic-scale waves tended to be stronger and more organized,
    enhancing TC formation likelihood
  abstract: The tropical cyclone (TC)-centric approach developed in previous studies
    tends to overemphasize the direct impact of tropical waves and underestimates
    their large-scale modulation of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclogenesis
    (TCG). To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new approach based
    on empirical orthogonal function analyses to re-examine associations of multiple
    waves, including the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), quasi-biweekly oscillation
    (QBWO), convective equatorial Rossby (ER) waves, and synoptic scale waves (SSWs),
    with WNP TCG events. There is a close association between WNP TCG events (total
    of 273 TCs in this study) and SSWs (~ 64%), MJO (~ 68%), QBWO (~ 64%) and ER (~ 65%)
    waves. These suggest that SSW is critical for many TCG events, and all of these
    intra-seasonal waves significantly modulate TCG events. A majority of TCs (~ 79%)
    were found to be related to more than one wave type, indicating an important role
    for a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic conditions associated with multiple
    waves in TCG events. Further analyses show that SSW activity is strongly modulated
    by the MJO and ER waves, while the QBWO has no significant impact on SSWs. During
    convectively active MJO and ER phases, stronger SSW trains with more distinct
    southeast-northwestward aligned structures can be found compared to convectively
    inactive phases. Similar intra-seasonal modulation of the transition from the
    mixed Rossby-gravity waves from the equatorial central Pacific to the SSW trains
    over the WNP by the three waves is noted, with such transitions largely favored
    during convectively active MJO and ER phases.

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4477-8
  keypoint1: Since the late 1990s, tropical cloud clusters have increased over the
    western North Pacific, especially over the eastern portion of the western North
    Pacific, but the frequency of TCs had decreased.
  keypoint2: There has been a decrease in genesis productivity, which was shown to
    be primarily due to increases in vertical wind shear in the eastern part of the
    western North Pacific.
  keypoint3: Since the late 1990s, the monsoon circulation in the western North Pacific
    has also weakened, shifting the upper-tropospheric trough farther west and increasing
    shear in the eastern part of the western North Pacific.
  abstract: Tropical cloud clusters (TCCs) play a critical role in sustaining tropical
    large-scale systems and are traditionally viewed as precursors for tropical cyclone
    (TC) genesis. This study focuses on the decadal changes in genesis productivity
    (GP), e.g. the efficiency of TCCs developing into TCs, and shows a significant
    decrease in GP over the western North Pacific (WNP) basin since 1998, when a climate
    regime change occurred. The significant decrease in TC frequency and the significant
    increase in TCCs, especially over the eastern region of the WNP basin, have combined
    to result in a reduced GP since 1998. These changes are dependent on the combined
    changes in large-scale atmospheric-oceanic conditions over the WNP basin. A decadal
    change in vertical wind shear, especially over the eastern portion of the WNP
    basin, appears to be the most important contributor to the recent decrease in
    GP. Increased vertical wind shear suppresses TC genesis but enhances the frequency
    of TCCs. Secondary positive contributions to the recent decrease in GP are from
    local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and low-level relative vorticity. These
    positive contributions to the recent decrease in GP are partly cancelled out by
    a negative contribution from enhanced mid-relative moisture. Changes in these
    large-scale conditions associated with the recent decrease in GP over the WNP
    basin since 1998 are closely related to the weakening monsoon circulation and
    the westward shift of the tropical upper-tropospheric trough over the WNP. This
    is likely related to the changes observed in tropical SST anomalies around the
    globe.

  keypoint1: Structural differences are observed in tropical cyclone composites organaized by intensity, intensity change, age, and the presence of a secondary wind maximum.
  keypoint2: Intensifying tropical cyclones are distinguished from their steady-state and weakening counterparts by the presence of a vorticity ring structure, higher inner- and outer-core moisture, and a notably drier eye.
  keypoint3: Structural differences in the tangential wind profiles of minor hurricanes are predominant in the inner-core region during the early life cycle whereas structural differences in the tangential wind profiles of major hurricanes are predominant in the outer-core region during the late life cycle.
  abstract: A comprehensive examination of tropical cyclone (TC) kinematic and thermodynamic structure in the Atlantic basin is created from the Extended Flight Level Dataset (FLIGHT+) for Tropical Cyclones (Version 1.1). In situ data collected at the 700-hPa flight level by NOAA WP-3D and USAF WC-130 aircraft from 1999 to 2012 are analyzed. A total of 233 azimuthal mean profiles comprising 1498 radial legs are stratified by TC intensity and 12-hour intensity change. A matrix of composite structures is created for minor (category 1 and 2) and major (category 3 and above) hurricanes that are intensifying [intensity increase greater than or equal to 10 kt in 12 h], steady-state [intensity change between +/- 5 kt in 12 h], and weakening [intensity decrease less than or equal to -10 kt in 12 h]. Additional considerations to the impacts of age on TC structure are given as well. Axisymmetric radial composites reveal that intensifying TCs have statistically significant structural differences from TCs that are steady-state or weakening, but that these differences also depend on the intensity of the TC. Intensifying TCs (both minor and major hurricanes) are characterized by steep tangential wind gradients radially inward of the radius of maximum tangential wind (RMW) that contributes to a ring-like structure of vorticity and inertial stability. Tangential wind structural differences are more pronounced in the eye of minor hurricanes compared to major hurricanes. Intensifying TCs are found to have higher inner and outer-core moisture compared to steady-state and weakening TCs. Furthermore, intensifying major hurricanes possess drier eyes compared to steady-state and weakening major hurricanes.

  caption: Storm-relative axisymmetric vertical vorticity composite means for (a) minor hurricanes and (b) major hurricanes. Intensifying (IN) TCs are denoted in solid red, steady-state (SS) TCs are denoted in dashed green, and weakening (WK) TCs are denoted in dotted blue. Radial locations where two composite means are significantly different at the 5% level appear thicker on the respective composite-mean curves and radial locations where all composite means are significantly different at the 5% level are shaded in gray.

  keypoint1: Patricia's structure was predominantly characterized by a hollow potential vorticity tower during its rapid intensification.
  keypoint2: Symmetric heating remained fixed to the same absolute angular momentum surfaces as they contracted in physical space, contributing to a rapid concentration of potential vorticity.
  keypoint3: Patricia's rapid over-water weakening was charactized by a dilution of the hollow potential vorticity tower and eddy mixing near the eye and eyewall region.
  abstract: Operational numerical models failed to predict the record-setting rapid intensification and rapid over-water weakening of Hurricane Patricia (2015) in the eastern North Pacific basin, resulting in large intensity forecast errors. In an effort to better understand the mesoscale processes contributing to Patricia's rapid intensity changes, we analyze high-resolution aircraft observations collected on 22-23 October. Spline-based variational analyses are created from observations collected via in situ measurements, Doppler radar, and full-tropospheric dropsonde profiles as part of the Office of Naval Research Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI) experiment and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Intensity Forecasting Experiment (IFEX). We present the first full-tropospheric calculation of the dry, axisymmetric Ertel's potential vorticity (PV) in a tropical cyclone without relying on balance assumptions. Detailed analyses reveal the formation of a "hollow tower" PV structure as Patricia rapidly approached its maximum intensity, and a subsequent breakdown of this structure during Patricia's rapid over-water weakening phase. Transforming the axisymmetric PV analyses from radius-height to potential radius-isentropic coordinates reveals that Patricia's rapid intensification was closely related to the distribution of diabatic heating and eddy mixing. During Patricia's rapid over-water weakening phase, eddy mixing processes are hypothesized to be the primary factor rearranging the PV distribution near the eye-eyewall region, diluting the PV previously confined to the hollow tower while approximately conserving the absolute circulation.
