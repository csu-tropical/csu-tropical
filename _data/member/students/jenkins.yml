  Chandler “CJ” Jenkins is a first-year M.S. student born in Augusta, GA, and raised in 
  Richland, WA. He earned his B.S. in Earth and Environmental Science from Washington 
  State University Tri-Cities. His passion for studying atmospheric science and tropical 
  cyclones blossomed after the historic 2005 hurricane season, leading him to pursue undergraduate 
  research opportunities with the National Science Foundation Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (NSF SOARS) program years later. Chandler’s first-year research aims to use a novel 3-layer model to investigate rapid intensification in Tropical Cyclones. In his free time, Chandler loves playing and watching basketball, indulging in various video games, and reading oversized fantasy novels.
