  Tyler Barbero is a first year M.S. student originally from Santa Clara, California.
  He received his B.S. in Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences and minor in Mathematics from
  Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California San Diego.
  His undergraduate research involved looking at dust dynamics and transport in
  Southern California but his interests took a turn when he interned at the
  Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) on a project investigating tropical cyclone (TC)
  track biases in GFS, IFS and GFDL SHiELD models. He plans to continue this research into
  his Masters and also explore other interests which include tropical waves,
  large-scale atmospheric and oceanic controls on TCs among others. Alongside research,
  Tyler aspires to teach and through this, inspire in people the same enthusiasm he has for
  this field. For pastime activities, he enjoys rock climbing, surfing (when near an ocean),
  and unwinding with a beer (or two) after a long week.
