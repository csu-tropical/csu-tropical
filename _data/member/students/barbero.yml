bio: >
  Tyler Barbero is a Ph.D. candidate from Santa Clara, California. He earned 
  his M.S. in the same research group, where his project looked at attributing hurricane 
  track forecast errors to errors in the large-scale steering motion in high-resolution 
  models. Tyler’s doctoral research leverages idealized modeling and theory to investigate 
  how tropical convection develops and organizes within African Easterly Waves. Alongside 
  his research, Tyler is passionate about teaching, mentoring, and community outreach. He 
  has helped teach core classes in the department, co-mentored a summer undergraduate 
  student, and served on the executive board of FORTCAST, CSU’s student AMS chapter, where 
  he helps promote science regionally through community outreach events. For pastime 
  activities, Tyler enjoys playing tennis competitively, listening to country music, and 
  eating delicious food!
