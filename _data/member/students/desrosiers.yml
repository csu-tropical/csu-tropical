  Alex is a Ph.D. candidate at Colorado State University.
  He was born and raised in Tampa Florida and obtained his Bachelor's Degree
  in Environmental Engineering from the University of Florida. An affinity for
  the outdoors has made Colorado an excellent new home. Alexâ€™s current research
   aims to identify internal mechanisms driving rapid intensification in recent
    Atlantic storms. In situ data such as the NOAA P-3 Tail Doppler Radar will
     be used to capture these mechanisms in action. This research also
     incorporates machine learning techniques to lessen the time and effort it
     takes to quality control radar data. The end goal is a better
     understanding of how rapid intensity changes occur in order to provide
     more information for modelers and forecasters.
