  Delián Colón Burgos is an M.S. student from Cayey, Puerto Rico.
  She received her B.S. in Meteorology and Atmospheric Science and a minor in Geography
  from The Pennsylvania State University. During her undergraduate years she participated in
   the NSF Weather, Climate, and Society REU, was a SOARS protégé at NCAR, and interned at
   the National Hurricane Center as a NOAA Hollings Scholar; all experiences that reaffirmed
   her research interests in tropical meteorology. She received the 2023 NSF Graduate Research
   Fellowship, which will support her research on tropical cyclogenesis and rapid intensification
   processes, through analyzing observational data from the TCRI and CPEX-CV2 field campaigns.
   She enjoys giving back to her community by mentoring younger students and educating about
   weather hazards. Delián also enjoys the outdoors, dancing, and spending time with her family
   and friends.
