  Ali Cole is a first year M.S. candidate. Prior to attending Colorado State
   University, Ali received a Bachelor of Science in Geography
   (Meteorology-Climatology) and a Bachelor of Science in Computational
   Mathematical Sciences from Arizona State University, where she researched
   gravity wave propagation at the tropopause. Her research interests now
   include heavy rainfall structures, particularly in tropical cyclones, which
    she investigates using the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF)
    and observations. She looks forward to participating in the PRECIP field
    campaign next summer and using LES-scale WRF runs to analyze rainfall
    structures. Ali grew up in Tucson, Arizona and has enjoyed watching
    monsoonal thunderstorms since she was young. Outside of her research,
    she enjoys exploring the outdoors in Colorado and trying to perfect her
     baking skills.
