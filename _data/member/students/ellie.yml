  Eleanor Casas is a Ph.D. candidate, and she is researching the tropical
  cyclone boundary layer (TCBL) and its relationship to TC intensification
  processes. Prior to attending Colorado State University, Eleanor received her
   Bachelor of Science in Meteorology from Valparaiso University where she
   researched lake-effect snow, and she began her graduate studies with Dr.
   Michael Bell at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Her Master’s of
   Atmospheric Science from Colorado State University identified a simplified
   logistic growth equation framework that relates the surface drag coefficient
    to TCBL structure and short-term TC intensification potential, and Eleanor
    is interested in expanding the applicability of this framework.
    Additionally, Eleanor is also interested in investigating several processes
     that influence TC rapid intensification, and she prefers to use a
     combination of observations, numerical modeling, and theory to address
     her research questions.
