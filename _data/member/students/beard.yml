  Lauren Beard is a first-year M.S. student from St. Louis, Missouri. She received her B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Lauren has pursued undergraduate research in various fields of study, including tracing cloud seeding trajectories to visualize dry air intrusions, analyzing radar observations to understand the microphysical properties of the frontal structure of extratropical cyclones, and analyzing lidar data to quantify turbulent structures around shallow cumulus clouds. In addition to her research, Lauren was a varsity athlete on the swim team. Her first-year research will leverage new techniques for deriving size distributions from polarimetric radar and apply variational methods for 3D multi-Doppler wind retrievals. She will also investigate the links between dynamical and microphysical processes as a function of aerosol concentration, environmental conditions, and precipitation formation. In her free time, Lauren enjoys photography, hiking, thrifting and listening to music.
