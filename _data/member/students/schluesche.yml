  Isaac is a first year M.S. student originally from Sun Praire, Wisconsin.
  He recieved his B.S. in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and Computer Science from
  the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He developed an interest in tropical cyclones through
  an undergraduate internship at the National Hurricane Center, where he worked on creating
  and analyzing and ensemble of statistical-dyanmical models. He plans to continue this project, and
  hopefully publish it in the near future! In his M.S., he will be working on developing
  software and investigating TC dyanmics using the Airborne Phased Array Radar (APAR) system.
  In his free time, he enjoys photography, running, hiking, and storm chasing (when Mother Nature sees fit).
