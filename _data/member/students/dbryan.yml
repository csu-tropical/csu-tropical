 "Deztynee Bryan is a first-year M.S student. She was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands and raised in Anguilla, where experiencing the devastation of Hurricane Irma in 2017 sparked her passion for studying hurricanes. She received her B.S in Meteorology from the Florida Institute of Technology. Deztynee is a NSF SOARS Protégé and has spent two summers at the Earth Observing Laboratory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Her interest in tropical cyclone research deepened as a member of the Airborne Phased Array Radar (APAR) Team, where she analyzed simulated radar observations to investigate the microphysical and kinematic properties of tropical cyclones and their relationship to storm evolution. She is also a recipient of the American Meteorological Society Graduate Fellowship, through which she will continue researching tropical cyclones with a focus on airborne radar retrievals. Beyond academics, Deztynee enjoys dancing, reading, and hiking."
