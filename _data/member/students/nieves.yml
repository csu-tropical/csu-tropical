  Angelie Nieves-Jiménez is an M.S. student born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
  Angelie graduated from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering.
  Her motivation to study Atmospheric Sciences during her undergraduate studies was complemented by her work as a SOARS Protégé for four years at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
  Angelie is interested in expanding her knowledge of tropical cyclone rapid intensification and associated rainfall.
  One of her main goals is to inspire the future generation and give back to her island by increasing education in this discipline and guiding the people when natural hazards are imminent.
  In her spare time, Angelie enjoys spending time with her family, friends, and her dog Nova in Puerto Rico and eating Puerto Rican fried food.
