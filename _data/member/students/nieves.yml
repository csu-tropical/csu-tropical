  Angelie Nieves-Jiménez is a second year M.S. student born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
  Angelie graduated from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering. Her motivation to study Atmospheric Sciences during her undergraduate studies was complemented by her work as a National Science Foundation Significant Opportunities In Atmospheric Research and Science (NSF SOARS) Protégé for four years at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). As a 2023 National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) recipient, Angelie works on improving knowledge of tropical cyclone rapid intensification and associated extreme rainfall. She devotes her time to volunteering on AMS Committees such as the AMS STAC Committee on Tropical Cyclones and Tropical Meteorology and the AMS Board on Representation, Accessibility,  Inclusion, and Diversity and is also a member of the AMS Early Career Leadership Academy 2024 (ECLA) cohort. One of her main goals is to inspire the future generation and give back to her island by increasing education in this discipline and guiding the community when natural hazards are imminent. In her spare time, Angelie enjoys spending time with her family, friends, and her dog Nova in Puerto Rico and eating Puerto Rican fried food.
