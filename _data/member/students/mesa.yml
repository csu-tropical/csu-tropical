  Nick Mesa is a Ph.D. candidate originally from Miami, Florida.
  He recently completed his M.S. degrees in Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University and came to Colorado State after having graduated from the University of Florida
  with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and a Certificate in Meteorology and Climatology.
  His undergraduate research experiences included working with the NOAA
  Hurricane Research Division as a William M. Lapenta Scholar in 2021, along with multiple
  research projects associated with the National Science Foundation Natural Hazards Engineering
  Research Infrastructure network. As a recipient of the American Meteorological Society
  Graduate Fellowship and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship,
  Nick's research will focus on tropical cyclones facing moderate shear and their intensification processes.
  His first-year research will use the Geostationary Lightning Mapper to investigate the relationship
  between lightning and developing tropical cyclones. Outside of work, Nick enjoys getting outside and active
  (ranging from playing sports, hiking, or biking), in addition to reading literary classics and books on
  Latin American history. You can also catch Nick keeping up with his beloved South Florida
  sports teams while he also jumps on the Colorado sports bandwagon.
