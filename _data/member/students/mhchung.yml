 Ming-Han Chung is a first-year Ph.D. student from Taiwan. He earned his B.S. from National Central University and his M.S. from National Taiwan University. During his Master's, he utilized K-means clustering to classify the TC genesis types and investigate their intensification processes using the WRF model. His doctoral research continues to focus on TC genesis, especially how vertical wind shear and convection distribution affect genesis processes. In his free time, he enjoys photography, storm chasing, stargazing, hiking, and cooking!
