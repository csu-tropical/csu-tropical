  Brenda is a Research Scientist III at Colorado State University. She received her Ph.D. 
  in Atmospheric Science from CSU in 2009. Brenda's research focuses on precipitation and 
  microphysical processes using polarimetric radar, satellites, and disdrometers. Brenda's 
  research interests include radar analysis and algorithms, observational integration and validation 
  of cloud-resolving models, precipitation processes, and cloud physics. She is an expert 
  in polarimetric radar, having developed one of the first hydrometeor identification 
  algorithms for short-wavelength radars (X- and C-band). Additionally, she has worked 
  with a wide variety of radars from around the world including ground, ship, and 
  satellite-based radars from Ka- to S-band. Brenda enjoys field work and has participated 
  in over 10 field projects as a radar or mission scientist. She works at the interface of 
  cloud resolving models and observations, using them synergistically to improve observational 
  retrievals and better model representation of physical processes. In her spare time, Brenda
  can be found baking, skiing, hiking, camping, or taking flying adventures with her pilot husband
  and two kids.
