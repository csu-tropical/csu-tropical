  Dandan is a Research Scientist I in the Department of Atmospheric Science at
  Colorado State University. Dandan’s primary interest is in moist convective
  systems, especially tropical cyclones. Dandan received her PhD from the
  Pennsylvania State University, working with Dr. Fuqing Zhang on the dynamics
  and predictability of tropical cyclones under vertical wind shear. Currently,
  she is working with Dr. Michael Bell and Dr. Peter Jan van Leeuwen on the
  tropical cyclone rapid intensification using ensemble forecasts of Hurricane
  Patricia (2015) initialized from data assimilation cycle analysis. At the
  same time, Dandan is also working on the evolution of tropical cyclone’s
  angular momentum structure during its development stage.
