  Levi Silvers is a Research Scientist in the Department of Atmospheric 
  Science at Colorado State University.  He received his Ph.D. in 
  Atmospheric Science from CSU in 2011.  Levi’s research is focused on 
  the mechanisms by which clouds and atmospheric moisture influence the 
  flow of energy through the Earth’s system.  There are many fascinating 
  phenomena in the Earth system that are influenced by the interacations
  between clouds and atmospheric moisture.  These include tropical cyclones, 
  overturning tropical circulations such as the Hadley and Walker circulations, 
  and the response of cloud radiative effects 
  to particular patterns of sea surface 
  temperature.  Levi’s research has made use of a variety of modeling 
  tools that include global Earth-like climate models, idealized 
  mock-Walker simulations, and simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium.

  After finishing his Ph.D. Levi moved to Germany for a post-doctoral position 
  at the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology.  Levi also worked at 
  the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory as the lead scientist for GFDL's 
  participation in the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project during 
  CMIP6 and as a Research Scientist at Stony Brook University in the School 
  of Marine and Atmospheric Science.  Levi derives great satisfaction from 
  spending time with his family and by being 
  outside, whether atop mountains or along the sea.
