  Jennifer is a Research Scientist II. In her research, Jennifer uses a
  combination of polarimetric radar observations and mesoscale models to
  understand the processes responsible for heavy tropical rainfall in a
  variety of weather systems. Prior to arriving at CSU, Jennifer received her
  Ph.D. from the University of Washington, where she worked with Prof. Robert
  Houze, Jr. to understand how external forcings affect the three-dimensional
  structure of tropical cyclones. Throughout her career, Jennifer has been
  fortunate to participate in several field campaigns, including VORTEX2, HS3,
  OLYMPEX, and the upcoming PRECIP campaign in 2021. In her free time, Jennifer
  enjoys traveling and eating delicious food.
