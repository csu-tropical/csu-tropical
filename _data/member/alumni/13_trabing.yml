  Ben earned his PhD at Colorado State University (CSU) in 2020.  He is now 
  an Associate Scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research
  (UCAR) working remotely for the National Hurricane Center. 
  His doctoral
  research involved multi-scale interactions between radiation and tropical
  cyclone structure and intensity. He received his M.S. in atmospheric science
  from CSU in 2018 and a bachelors in meteorology from the University of
  Oklahoma (OU) in 2016. Ben conducted undergraduate research while working at
   the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the Cooperative Institute for
   Mesoscale Meteorological Studies. Ben's research interests include tropical
    meteorology, radiative transfer in the atmosphere, and storm
    electrification. You can find more about Ben and his research at his
