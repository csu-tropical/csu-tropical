bio: >
  Isaac is originally from Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.
  He received his B.S. in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and Computer Science from
  the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He developed an interest in tropical cyclones through
  an undergraduate internship at the National Hurricane Center, where he worked on creating
  and analyzing an ensemble of statistical-dynamical models. His current research focuses on leveraging 
  machine learning techniques to retrieve microphysical information from meteorological radars. He also 
  helps develop the Ronin.jl software package, which uses machine learning to remove non-meteorological data from radar sweeps. 
  In his free time, he enjoys photography, running, hiking, and storm chasing (when Mother Nature sees fit).
