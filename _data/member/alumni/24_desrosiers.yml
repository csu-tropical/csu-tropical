bio: >
  Alex earned his Ph.D. from Colorado State University in 2024.
  He was born and raised in Tampa Florida and obtained his Bachelor's Degree
  in Environmental Engineering from the University of Florida. An affinity for
  the outdoors has made Colorado an excellent new home. Alexâ€™s PhD research
   sought to identify internal mechanisms driving rapid intensification in recent
    Atlantic storms. In situ data such as the NOAA P-3 Tail Doppler Radar where 
     used to capture these mechanisms in action. This research also
     incorporates machine learning techniques to lessen the time and effort it
     takes to quality control radar data. Alex's end goal was to develop a better
     understanding of how rapid intensity changes occur in order to provide
     more information for modelers and forecasters.
