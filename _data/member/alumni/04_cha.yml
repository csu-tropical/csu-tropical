bio: >
  Ting-Yu earned her Ph.D. in 2023. She researched the mesoscale
  structure, evolution, and precipitation of tropical cyclones with
  ground-based and airborne radar data and numerical simulations. She received
  a B.S in Atmospheric Science from National Taiwan University in 2016, and
  her M.S. in Atmospheric Science from CSU in 2018. Her research interests are
  in understanding thermodynamic, dynamics, and microphysics interactions in
  TC intensity change and extreme precipitation and improving radar research
  tools. She has been collaborating with the National Center for Atmospheric
  Research (NCAR) to develop the LROSE radar tools and is involved in the
  Airborne Phased Array Radar (APAR) project. She will participate in the
  PRECIP 2021 field campaign in Taiwan, and use the observational dataset to
  understand the key mechanism related to heavy precipitation. In her spare
  time, Ting-Yu enjoys hiking, snowboarding, and traveling.
