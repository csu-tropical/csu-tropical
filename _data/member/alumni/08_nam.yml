bio: >
  Chelsea Nam is a postdoctoral fellow studying convective structure and evolution
   during tropical cyclone genesis. To better understand the complex,
    multi-scale tropical cyclogenesis, she uses a number of different
    datasets and methods including radar (airborne, shipborne) data, ensemble
     high-resolution mesoscale models (WRF and CM1) and large-scale reanalyses.
      She graduated from her PhD at Colorado State University (CSU) in 2021 working
      with Dr. Michael Bell. She received a B.S in earth science from Seoul National University (SNU)
      at South Korea in 2015, and her M.S in atmospheric science from SNU in
        2017. During her Masterâ€™s, she researched TC risk in statistical and
        climatological perspective working with Dr. Chang-Hoi Ho and Dr.
        Doo-Sun R. Park. She has a passion for teaching; she completed the graduate
        teaching certificate program at CSU while serving an instructor
        for the undergraduate Intro course for atmospheric science at CSU in
        2019 and as a teaching assistant for Atmospheric Dynamics II course in 2020.
