abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the interannual variability of rapid intensification (RI) magnitude of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclones. There is a significant correlation between basin-averaged RI magnitude during July–November and the simultaneous Western Pacific (WP) teleconnection index from 1982 to 2021. RI magnitude is, on average, larger (smaller) in positive (negative) WP phases. During a positive WP, RI magnitude changes exhibit a southwest-northeast dipolar pattern, with significant increases over the southwestern quadrant of the WNP and weak decreases over the northern part of the WNP. The WP teleconnection relates to RI magnitude primarily through modulation of 850–200-hPa vertical wind shear, with less influence from 850-hPa relative vorticity. The changes in these two dynamic conditions can be linked to WP-induced circulation anomalies at lower and upper levels. Our results highlight that different contributors may be responsible for changes in WNP RI occurrence and RI magnitude.},
