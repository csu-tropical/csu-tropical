Jon Martinez is a PhD candidate. Jon was born and raised in Hollywood, Florida where he experienced several landfalling hurricanes that inspired his interest in tropical cyclone research. Jon’s primary research focuses on understanding the mesoscale structure and evolution of tropical cyclones with high-resolution observational data and numerical simulations. Jon’s research interests also include severe wind production in mesoscale convective systems; tropical cyclone frequency and risk assessment amidst Earth's warming climate system; tropical cyclogenesis and climate variability; and the economics of climate change. Jon was recently awarded the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Advanced Study Program (ASP) Postdoctoral Fellowship. As an ASP Postdoctoral Fellow, Jon will investigate how tropical cyclone frequency might change amidst Earth's warming climate system by analyzing variability in the processes that contribute to tropical cyclone formation.
